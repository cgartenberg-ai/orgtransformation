| **AI Jason** | AI tool news | Product/tool launches |
| **David Shapiro** | AI commentary | Industry analysis |

### How to Use Daily Shows

**Efficiency strategy**: Don't listen to every episode. Instead:

1. **Scan titles daily** - Look for keywords: "lab", "announces", "launches", "Chief AI", "spin-off", "raises"
2. **Scan show notes** - Faster than listening; contains guest names, company mentions, timestamps
3. **Flag relevant episodes** - Queue for full listen if org-relevant
4. **Use transcripts** - Search Podscribe for keywords across daily shows
5. **Weekly batch** - Review week's headlines in one session

### Show Notes: What to Look For

Show notes are the fastest way to triage episodes. Most podcasts publish them on:
- Podcast website/blog
- Apple Podcasts description
- Spotify description
- YouTube description (for video podcasts)
- Substack (many podcasts have companion newsletters)

**Show notes typically contain:**
| Element | What to Extract |
|---------|-----------------|
| Guest name + title | Identify AI leaders, lab founders |
| Company mentions | Flag if relevant company discussed |
| Topic bullets | Quick summary of what's covered |
| Timestamps | Jump directly to relevant sections |
| Links | Articles, announcements referenced |
| Sponsor reads | Sometimes reveal enterprise AI partnerships |

**Show notes scanning workflow:**
```
1. RSS reader or podcast app → scan new episode titles
2. Click through to show notes for promising titles
3. Ctrl+F / search show notes for keywords:
   - Company names on watchlist
   - "lab", "CEO", "Chief", "Head of"
   - "announces", "launches", "raises"
   - "strategy", "organization", "team"
4. If keywords found → read full show notes
5. If highly relevant → listen or read transcript
```

**Tools for show notes aggregation:**
| Tool | How to Use |
|------|------------|
| **Podcast Addict** (Android) | Shows full descriptions, searchable |
| **Overcast** (iOS) | Good show notes display |
| **Pocket Casts** | Cross-platform, notes accessible |
| **RSS reader** (Feedly, Inoreader) | Subscribe to podcast RSS feeds for notes |
| **Podcast websites** | Often have fuller notes than apps |
| **YouTube descriptions** | Video podcasts have detailed timestamps |

**Pro tip:** Many podcasts post show notes to their Substack/newsletter before or with the episode. Subscribe to:
- Latent Space newsletter
- Cognitive Revolution newsletter
- No Priors newsletter
- Acquired newsletter

**High-signal keywords in titles AND show notes**:
```
IMMEDIATE LISTEN:
- "[Company] launches AI lab"
- "[Company] announces AI strategy"
- "Chief AI Officer"
- "[Person] joins/leaves [Company]"
- "AI spin-off", "AI subsidiary"
- "$X billion AI investment"
- Guest title contains: "Chief", "Head of AI", "VP AI", "Director"

WORTH CHECKING:
- "[Company] AI update"
- "Enterprise AI"
- "AI reorganization"
- "AI team"
- Guest from company on watchlist
```

### Timestamps: Skip to Relevant Sections

Many podcasts include timestamps in show notes. Use them to:
- Skip intros/sponsor reads
- Jump to specific guest segments
- Find the "AI strategy" or "organization" discussion
- Avoid off-topic tangents

**Common timestamp patterns:**
```
00:00 - Intro
05:30 - Guest background  ← Often reveals career path
15:00 - Company strategy  ← Key section
35:00 - AI organization   ← Key section
50:00 - Future plans      ← May reveal new initiatives
```
