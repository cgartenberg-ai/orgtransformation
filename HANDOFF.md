# Session Handoff — February 8, 2026 (Session 6)

## CRITICAL: Read This First

Session 6 was an analytical session — no agents launched. We reviewed all 294 purpose claims and identified fundamental problems with the v1.0 taxonomy. Developed a complete taxonomy revision plan (v1.0 → v2.0).

### What Was Completed (Feb 8 — Session 6)

**Purpose Claims Taxonomy Revision (analytical work, no code changes):**
- Reviewed all 294 claims across 7 types
- Identified that 3 types (utopian, teleological, identity) capture genuine "planes of meaning" (what END the claim invokes) while 4 types (transformation-framing, employee-deal, sacrifice-justification, direction-under-uncertainty) are surface-level grab bags
- Developed v2.0 taxonomy: 6 types organized by what END the claim points toward
- Decided to drop employee-deal entirely (37 claims — most are managerial directives, not purpose claims; ~5-8 are identity claims in disguise)
- Dissolved transformation-framing, sacrifice-justification, direction-under-uncertainty — claims to be reclassified by underlying end
- Added 3 new types: higher-calling, survival, commercial-success
- **Full plan with decision rules, examples, and execution steps:** `research/purpose-claims/TAXONOMY-REVISION-PLAN.md`

### Priority 1 for Next Session: Execute Taxonomy Revision

Read `research/purpose-claims/TAXONOMY-REVISION-PLAN.md` — it has everything needed:
- New 6-type taxonomy with definitions, examples, and distinguishing criteria
- Step-by-step execution plan (10 steps)
- Decision rules for edge cases
- Files to modify
- Expected outcomes (~30-40 claims dropped, ~255-265 active claims remaining)

**Execution order:** employee-deal first (37 claims, clearest decisions) → sacrifice-justification (24) → transformation-framing (59) → direction-under-uncertainty (58) → quick review of utopian/teleological/identity (116)

### Still Pending from Sessions 4-5 (lower priority than taxonomy revision)

## Immediate Next Steps (Start Here)

### Priority 1: Execute Taxonomy Revision

**Read `research/purpose-claims/TAXONOMY-REVISION-PLAN.md` first.** This is a detailed plan with all context needed. Reclassify all 294 claims from v1.0 (7 types) to v2.0 (6 types). Update PURPOSE-CLAIMS-SPEC.md, registry.json, site components.

### Priority 2: Process 10 Pending Research Files

Ten rich agent outputs in `research/pending/` need processing:

| File | Size | Key Content |
|------|------|-------------|
| `goldman-sachs-deep-scan.json` | 49KB | OneGS 3.0, AI troika, new specimen |
| `morgan-stanley-deep-scan.json` | 39KB | Firmwide AI Head, new specimen |
| `podcast-substack-feed-check.json` | 22KB | Feed status, McKinsey 25K agents, SpaceX-xAI |
| `general-sweep-feb-2026.json` | ~12KB | Panasonic CAIO, Citigroup, Lionsgate |
| `earnings-q4-2025-amazon-google.json` | ~49KB | Amazon $200B CapEx, Google 50% AI-written code |
| `earnings-discovery-q4-2025.json` | ~30KB | Genpact, Cognizant, Thomson Reuters |
| `podcast-deep-scan-feb-2026.json` | ~25KB | Dwarkesh×Musk, Mollick management thesis |
| `general-sweep-feb-2026-v2.json` | ~20KB | Dow Chemical, Washington Post, Pinterest |
| `pharma-earnings-q4-2025.json` | 27KB | Pfizer M4 confirmation, Sanofi identity, Novo absence |
| `financial-services-earnings-q4-2025.json` | 30KB | JPMorgan structural separation, UBS CAIO, 5-bank comparison |

**Processing steps for each:**
1. Write consolidated session file(s) to `research/sessions/`
2. Add new orgs to `research/queue.json` for curation
3. Update `research/source-registry.json` with scanned-through dates
4. Update `research/field-signals.json` with new signals
5. Update `research/earnings-calendar.json` with scan results
6. Update `research/SESSION-LOG.md`
7. Clean up `research/pending/` after processing

### Priority 3: Relaunch Crashed Research Agents

**Industrials** — Siemens, ABB, Schneider Electric, Honeywell
- Crashed twice. Relaunch in fresh session with 4 search queries max, 5 URL fetches max.

**Targeted company sweep** — Split into 2 lean agents:
- Agent A: John Deere, Caterpillar, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, BMW (NEW companies, highest value)
- Agent B: Sanofi enrichment, Coca-Cola, Walmart enrichment, Morgan Stanley enrichment, JPMorgan enrichment

### Priority 4: Relaunch Batch 8 Purpose Claims

nvidia, jpmorgan, duolingo, tesla — all crashed in Session 4, not reattempted in Session 5.

### Priority 5: Curate New Specimens

New orgs discovered across all research runs that need curation:
- **Goldman Sachs** — M4 candidate, exceptionally rich data
- **Morgan Stanley** — M4 or M2 candidate
- **McKinsey** — 25K AI agents / 40K humans, VERY HIGH specimen potential
- **Genpact** — dual operating system (BPO + AI unit), three-pillar agentic ops
- **Cognizant** — three-unit AI reorg, "broader pyramid" workforce
- **Thomson Reuters** — quantified AI displacement ($39M+ severance)
- **Panasonic** — dual CAIO + SRO appointment
- **Citigroup** — Project Bora Bora, Fraser purpose claims
- **SpaceX-xAI** — "personal conglomerate" model, $1.25T

### Priority 6: Git Commit

5 sessions of uncommitted work from Feb 7.

## Implicit Knowledge

1. **Opus model for all background agents.** Sonnet crashes during WebFetch; Opus completes reliably with superior analysis.
2. **Serial WebFetch only in agents.** Parallel WebFetch causes sibling-error cascades.
3. **Max 4 agents simultaneously.** More than 4 causes crashes. Stagger launches.
4. **Long-session agent crashes.** After many agent runs in one session, later agents crash even at 2 concurrent. Industrials + targeted sweep crashed twice each in Session 5. Fresh session needed for these.
5. **Pentagon-CDAO excluded.** Political entities don't belong in purpose claims analysis.
6. **Shared claim constants** in `site/components/purpose-claims/claim-constants.ts`.
7. **Heatmap + Dot Map** are pure Tailwind CSS (no D3). Both have model/industry group-by toggle.
8. **Build verified** at 129 pages after Session 3 changes.
9. **Track 1 is caught up** — all 93 specimens curated and synthesized, queues empty. Multiple new orgs will add to curation queue once research is processed.
10. **Goldman Sachs findings are exceptional** — OneGS 3.0, AI troika, Acceleration Team, 95% S-1 automation, "AI natives" thesis.
11. **Motley Fool transcripts work.** Fool.com earnings call transcripts are reliably fetchable via WebFetch — use as primary transcript source (SeekingAlpha is paywalled, Yahoo/CNBC are JS-rendered).
12. **Pharma M4 confirmed.** Pfizer's Boshoff "embedding AI engineers in each function" is the clearest M4 articulation. Novo Nordisk AI narrative absent under new CEO — type specimen status may need revisiting.
13. **Financial services divergence.** Three distinct workforce strategies: reduction (Citi/Wells), redeployment (BofA), hiring (JPMorgan). All converging on "agentic" framing.
14. **Stratechery paywalled.** Benedict Evans interview on "future of the corporation" and SaaSmageddon coverage are high-priority but inaccessible to agents. Manual read needed.
15. **Taxonomy v2.0 pending.** The v1.0 taxonomy (7 types) is being revised to v2.0 (6 types). The organizing principle changed from "rhetorical function" to "what END does the claim invoke to justify AI transformation." Three types kept (utopian, teleological, identity), employee-deal dropped entirely, three old types dissolved and redistributed, three new types added (higher-calling, survival, commercial-success). Full plan: `research/purpose-claims/TAXONOMY-REVISION-PLAN.md`.
16. **Batch 8 purpose claims should use v2.0 taxonomy** when relaunched. Update the scanning protocol in the purpose-claims SKILL.md after the taxonomy revision is executed.
17. **"Commercial-success" is a full category.** Some leaders justify AI transformation with nothing more than commercial logic — better customer experience, growth, efficiency. This is a genuine end, not a lesser one. The analytical payoff is precisely in the variation: some leaders reach for civilizational destiny, others stay within business logic. Dropping commercial-success would eliminate the baseline needed to see that variation.
