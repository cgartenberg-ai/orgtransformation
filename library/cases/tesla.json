      "Former AI Director Andrej Karpathy: 'Build a dataset; train your network; deploy it and test it. When you notice that the network is misbehaving, you incorporate the errors into the training set.'",
      "Every week, robots process 1.5 petabytes of data requiring massive compute to train",
      "The fleet identifies edge cases that humans would never anticipate",
      "Vision-only approach (no LiDAR, no HD maps): 'It's actually quite unscalable to collect, build, and maintain high-definition lidar maps.'"

    "coreInsight": "Design products that generate training data as a byproduct of usage. The more customers use the product, the better it gets. This creates a flywheel competitors without deployed fleets cannot replicate.",
