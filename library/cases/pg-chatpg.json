    "whatItIs": "Rather than a traditional 'innovation lab,' P&G's approach was to build an internal AI tool and immediately deploy it to thousands of users, treating the entire company as the experimental platform.",
    "howItWorks": [
      "Built ChatPG (internal generative AI tool) and rejected 'small pilot then scale' approach",
      "Decision: test with thousands of people immediately to get it in use quickly",
      "'In the first two hours when they launched at P&G, they received 8,000 requests'",
      "Company-wide launch followed within 2-3 months",
      "Partnership with Harvard Business School's Digital Data Design Institute for rigorous academic validation",
      "Field experiment with 776 professionals: 'Individuals using chatPG achieved the same performance level as teams that did not use the AI tool, while teams that partnered with chatPG consistently produced the best outcomes'"
    ],
    "coreInsight": "For enterprise AI adoption, skip small pilots. Deploy broadly, measure rigorously with academic partners, and iterate fast based on real usage data rather than theoretical concerns.",
    "keyMetrics": "30,000+ users, mandatory 10-minute training and acceptable use policy, 35+ use cases with internal data integration. Three deployed products: ChatPG, ImagePG, AskPG. Platform enables switching between AI models 'as deemed necessary from a business perspective'\u2014avoiding vendor lock-in.",
