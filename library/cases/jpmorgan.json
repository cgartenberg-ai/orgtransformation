    "2026AgenticPhase": "JPMorgan has begun deploying agentic AI to handle complex multistep tasks. Derek Waldron: 'As those agents become increasingly powerful and increasingly connected into JPMorgan, they can take on more and more responsibilities.' The bank expects to invest $18B in technology this year. AI integration projected to enable 10% reduction in operations staff within five years due to automation of routine tasks like fraud detection and account setup.
