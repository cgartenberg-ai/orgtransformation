    "whatItIs": "Waystar announced agentic intelligence at JPM 2026, articulating a vision for the 'autonomous revenue cycle'\u2014where AI agents handle healthcare billing, denials, and claims without human intervention.",

      "2025: Processed 7.5+ billion insurance transactions\u2014proprietary data as key differentiator",
      "July 2025: Acquired Iodine Software (processes one in three clinical hospital discharges) adding 'troves of new data to train and refine AI models'",
      "Building 'dynamic, end-to-end agentic network that continuously acts within workflows, executes defined tasks, and learns from outcomes with minimal intervention'",
      "Platform includes 150+ AI-trained models",
      "In seconds, agentic AI analyzes full medical record, prioritizes 30,000 most relevant data points, auto-populates correction requests with clinical context"

    "coreInsight": "Healthcare administrative AI should aim for 'autonomous' rather than 'assisted' operations. Build agentic networks (150+ models) that execute tasks end-to-end. Proprietary transaction data (7.5B+ annually) becomes the moat. The TAM expansion thesis: AI transforms market size, not just market share.",
    "keyMetrics": "$15.5B in prevented denials. ~40% reduction in manual correction workload. 95% time savings in denial-related workflows. TAM projected to grow from $20-25B to $55B by 2030.",
