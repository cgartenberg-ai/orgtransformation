      "CEO Tobi Lutke mandate (April 2025): employees must 'show jobs can't be done by artificial intelligence before asking for more headcount and resources'",
      "AI usage now 'a baseline expectation' that influences performance reviews",
      "Lutke expects employees to use AI as 'a thought partner, deep researcher, critic, tutor, or pair programmer'",

The AI mandate has become an industry template: 8 months after L\u00fctke's memo, Meta, Microsoft, Google, and NVIDIA have adopted similar metrics. The memo functioned as a 'filter'\u2014reshaping who would want to work at Shopify and who would thrive. All employees have access to Copilot, Claude, and Cursor."
