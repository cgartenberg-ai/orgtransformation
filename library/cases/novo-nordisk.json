      "CAIO reports to executive leadership, ensuring AI has board-level visibility and strategic alignment"
    ],
    "coreInsight": "The 'Make Your Time Count' framing transforms AI adoption from a threat narrative to an empowerment narrative - employees see AI as a tool to reclaim time for higher-value work rather than a replacement for their jobs.",
