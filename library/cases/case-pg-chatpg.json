This represents a systematic scaling of their original field experiment methodology, providing \"a vehicle — including data sources, software tools, methods, and defined security protocols — to rapidly develop, test, deploy, and scale AI models\" [1].\n\n## Strategic Framework: \"Constructive Disruption\"\n\nThe company has formalized their transformation approach under the strategic theme of **\"constructive disruption,\"** which has been consistently featured in their annual reports from 2022 through 2024 [2]. This signals that their AI transformation \"is not a short-term reaction to industry hype but a long-term, consistent strategy to proactively reshape its own business and the market at large\" [2].\n\n## Three-Pillar Scaling Strategy\n\nP&G's current approach focuses on three key areas for scaling AI initiatives [3][5]:\n- **Clearly articulating business purposes** for AI implementations\n- **Building organizational AI fluency and skills** across the workforce  \n- **Standardizing and automating AI development** throughout P&G enterprises for speed and efficiency\n\n## Operational Applications\n\nThe company is now applying their scaled AI approach to core business operations, including **automated modeling and simulation to overcome supply chain issues and improve fabric care formula design** [4]. They've integrated \"numerous detergent formulas into our core data lake, which now allows for faster development\" [4].\n\nHowever, the search results don't reveal specific updates on the Harvard Business School partnership study results or detailed metrics on the current usage of ChatPG, ImagePG, and AskPG platforms since the initial deployment.",
