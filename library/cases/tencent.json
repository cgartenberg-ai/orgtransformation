    "whatItIs": "Tencent's restructuring represents a direct response to market realities in the AI race. Previously, model R&D teams and resources were scattered across different business groups, leading to unfocused R&D efforts and resource waste.",
    "howItWorks": [
      "Previously: Hunyuan team spanned multiple departments (Large Language Model, AI Lab, Machine Learning Platform) in scattered structure",
      "Reorganization: Established unified departments in TEG\u2014AI Infra Department, AI Data Department, and Data Computing Platform",
      "Objective shift: From simply inventing AI (traditional lab mission) to manufacturing and deploying at industrial scale",
      "Leadership: Yao Shunyu (former OpenAI researcher) joined as Chief AI Scientist in CEO/President's Office",
      "Talent magnet: Appointment rapidly attracted core employees from ByteDance, Alibaba, and competitors"
    ],
    "coreInsight": "When AI R&D becomes strategic, scattered teams across business units must be consolidated into unified departments. The 'hub-and-spoke' model maintains connections to business needs while centralizing technical resources. Executive AI appointments (Chief AI Scientist reporting to CEO) signal organizational priority and attract top talent.",
    "keyMetrics": "Hunyuan 2.0: 406B parameters (32B active), 256K context. 30+ new models released in past year. Hunyuan Image 3.0 ranks #8 on LM Arena with 80B parameters.",
