    "whatItIs": "Meta's AI organization underwent major restructuring in 2025-2026, splitting research between the original FAIR (Fundamental AI Research) lab and a new Superintelligence Labs division focused on AGI. This followed tensions between research leadership and product demands.",
    "howItWorks": [
      "FAIR (Fundamental AI Research) founded 2013, focused on open-source models (Llama) and long-term research",
      "New Superintelligence Labs division created under Alexandr Wang (Scale AI founder, acquired 49% stake for $14.3B)",
      "Shengjia Zhao (former OpenAI researcher) appointed Chief Scientist of Superintelligence Labs",
      "Yann LeCun remained FAIR head but departed in November 2025 to launch AMI Labs (targeting $3.5B valuation)",
      "LeCun publicly disagreed with Zuckerberg's LLM focus, calling them 'useful but fundamentally limited'",
