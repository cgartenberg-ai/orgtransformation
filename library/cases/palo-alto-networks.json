    "whatItIs": "Palo Alto Networks represents an embedded AI adoption model where 2,500 developers across the cybersecurity company use Claude Code (Anthropic) as their primary AI development assistant. Rather than creating a separate AI lab, the company integrates AI tools directly into existing development workflows.",
    "howItWorks": [
      "Claude Code deployed to entire 2,500-developer workforce as standard development tool",
      "AI assists with code generation, review, documentation, and debugging",
      "Junior developers use AI for accelerated onboarding - learning codebases 70% faster",
      "Senior developers leverage AI for increased feature velocity (20-30% improvement)",
      "No separate AI team - capability embedded in existing engineering organization"
    ],
    "coreInsight": "The embedded model treats AI as a productivity multiplier within existing roles rather than a separate capability. The 70% faster onboarding metric suggests AI can flatten the experience curve - junior developers can contribute meaningfully much sooner.",
