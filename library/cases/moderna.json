    "2026Restructuring": "After reporting a $1B quarterly loss in 2025, Moderna is restructuring to treat AI as a collaborator rather than just a tool. Created new role of Chief People and Digital Technology Officer to oversee merged HR and tech departments. This enables 'work planning' instead of 'workforce planning'\u2014managers assess tasks based on whether they should be automated, augmented, or performed by a person. mChat evolved into a Chrome extension connected to databases without storing conversations. Key GPTs: Dose ID (clinical data analysis for augmenting clinical judgment), Contract Companion (90-95% time savings on legal contracts\u2014now company-wide asset). 40% of weekly active users actively creating GPTs, averaging 120 ChatGPT Enterprise conversations per week."
