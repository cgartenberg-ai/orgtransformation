    "whatItIs": "Deloitte's research on agentic AI adoption reveals a stark gap: while 30% explore and 38% pilot, only 14% have solutions ready to deploy and a mere 11% are actively using these systems in production.",

    "coreInsight": "The 11% production deployment rate reveals the real barrier: organizational capacity, not technology. Success requires process redesign (not overlay), explicit workforce change management, infrastructure modernization, and governance-as-enabler. The question isn't 'how do we use AI?' but 'how do we rebuild around AI?'",
