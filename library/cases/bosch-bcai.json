    "coreInsight": "Rather than a centralized AI lab, create a 'network' of AI experts spanning research and business divisions. This enables AI expertise to flow into virtually every product development. The network model suits diversified industrial conglomerates better than a single lab, as it maintains domain context while sharing AI methodologies. Board-level AI leadership signals strategic priority.",
