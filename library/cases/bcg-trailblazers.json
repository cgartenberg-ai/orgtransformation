    "whatItIs": "BCG's AI Radar 2026 survey of 2,360 executives identified 'Trailblazers' representing ~15% of companies who drive AI transformation through decisive investment in workforce capability.",
    "howItWorks": [
      "Defining characteristic: 60% of Trailblazing CEOs' AI budgets go to upskilling and retraining current workforce (vs. 27% Pragmatists, 24% Followers)",
      "CEO personal investment: Trailblazing CEOs spend 8+ hours per week on their own AI upskilling\u2014twice the counterpart average",
      "Agentic AI deployment: Trailblazers direct 50%+ of 2026 AI investment to agents, 2x more likely to deploy end-to-end",
      "Regional finding: Africa leads globally with 42% Trailblazer CEOs (vs. 14% EU), averaging 8.3 hours/week learning AI",

    "coreInsight": "The Trailblazer model inverts typical AI investment priorities: 60% to workforce upskilling, not technology. CEO personal commitment (8+ hours/week learning) signals organizational seriousness. The 15% who lead create competitive distance from the 85% who follow.",
    "keyMetrics": "15% Trailblazers vs. 85% followers. 60% budget to upskilling. 8+ hours/week CEO personal learning. 50% of non-CEOs think CEO should resign if company loses share due to inadequate AI strategy.",
