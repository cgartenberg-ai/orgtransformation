    "whatItIs": "Klarna's AI experiment provides a rare honest case study of both AI's potential and its limits. They publicly reversed course after going 'full tilt toward AI-based support.'",
    "howItWorks": [
      "February 2024: AI assistant announced as 'doing the equivalent work of 700 full-time agents' within first month",
      "Initial results: 2.3 million conversations, matching human satisfaction scores",
      "25% drop in repeat inquiries, resolution time dropped from 11 minutes to under 2 minutes",
      "$40 million annual savings projected; workforce shrank 40% from 5,000 to ~3,000",
      "By 2025, Klarna reversed course, resuming human hiring after acknowledging 'a full tilt toward AI-based support roles resulted in lower quality work'",
      "New model: Hybrid approach with AI handling simple inquiries, humans handling nuance and complexity"
    ],
    "coreInsight": "AI can achieve dramatic efficiency gains in customer service, but pure AI replacement creates quality problems. The sustainable model is human-AI hybrid where AI handles volume and humans handle complexity. Be willing to publicly reverse course when the data shows problems.",
    "keyMetrics": "CEO Siemiatkowski: 'It is important that customers always have a clear path to a human.' Company now recruits remote support staff in 'Uber type of setup.'",
