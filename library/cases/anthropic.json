    "whatItIs": "A two-part innovation model: (1) a dedicated Labs team focused on 'disruptive zero-to-one ideas' that operates independently from core product, and (2) a company-wide product philosophy of 'ride the exponential'\u2014building for capabilities that don't exist yet.",
    "howItWorks": [
      "Labs team is separate from main product organization, focused on exploratory/disruptive innovation",
      "Labs built Claude CLI (later Claude Code), early computer use explorations, and other experimental bets",
      "Once Labs creates something promising, it gets 'buttoned up and put on a more fancy suit' for public release",
      "Internal adoption validates before external release: Claude CLI 'rapidly overtook every other coding tool we had internally' in 3 months",
      "Regular hackathons (2-3x/year) where internal teams build on Labs innovations",
      "Over time, they delete parts of the harness rather than add to it because the model can do more"

    "coreInsight": "CPO Mike Krieger: 'The more you can align with the company's general long-term perspective about where powerful AI will come from, the smoother things will go because [Anthropic] is nothing but focused.'",
