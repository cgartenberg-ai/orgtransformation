    "2026StrategicShift": "X is increasingly spinning out projects as independent companies rather than keeping them within Alphabet. Series X Capital ($500M+ raised, run by former YouTube exec Gideon Yu) invests in X spinouts with Alphabet as minority investor. Recent moonshots: Anori (AI for real estate/construction), Moonshot for Circularity (plastics recycling with hyperspectral imaging), Tapestry (AI-powered electric grid visibility), Project Bellwether (wildfire/flood prediction). Reports indicate budget shrinkage and evolving from 'renegade team' to 'startup incubator' as Alphabet focuses on core AI products."
