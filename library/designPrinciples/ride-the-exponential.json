  "insight": "If you build for what AI can reliably do today, you'll be behind when capabilities improve (which happens fast). Build for what's barely possible, accept breakage, and be ready when capabilities arrive. Design products that naturally get better as models improve—and delete scaffolding over time rather than adding to it.",

    "Companies that 'pushed the limits with earlier models, hit walls, and then were ready when new capabilities emerged' are the ones succeeding (Cursor, Lovable)",
