  "insight": "Unprotected '20% time' fails because operational demands always win when there's no structural protection. But full separation isn't the only answer—what matters is that exploration time is protected, not that it's 100%.",
  "manifestations": [
    "Full separation (Samsung C-Lab, Google X): 100% dedicated for extended periods",
    "Dedicated core + rotating contributors: Small full-time nucleus with operational people doing tours of duty",
    "Time-boxed sprints (tiger teams): Pull people out fully for 6-8 weeks",
    "Protected time blocks with structural commitment: 'Fridays are lab days' with executive enforcement"
