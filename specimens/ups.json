  "description": "UPS is executing the most dramatic AI-driven restructuring in logistics history, eliminating 48,000+ positions in 2025 (10% of its 490,000-person workforce) with 20-30,000 more planned for 2026 \u2014 totaling 68,000+ through early 2026. The restructuring is powered by a $9B automation investment through 2028, targeting $3B in labor cost savings.\n\nThe structural transformation goes beyond headcount reduction. UPS is explicitly targeting management layers, not just operational roles. AI automation reduces coordination complexity between facilities, enabling organizational delayering and potential region consolidation. At the Louisville 'Velocity' hub, robots outnumber workers 15:1, with processing speed up ~300%. In December 2025, UPS ordered 400 Pickle Robot units for $120M \u2014 each robot unloads a truck in ~2 hours and pays for itself in 18 months. 57% of packages now move through automated facilities.\n\nThe restructuring also includes closing ~93 facilities in 2025 and 24 more in 2026 (~200 total by 2029), spinning off the freight business by June 2026, and reducing Amazon volume by >50% by June 2026 (driving $3.5B cost removal). This represents a fundamental shift from a labor-intensive to an automation-intensive operating model.",
