  "description": "The UK Government appointed Kalbir Sohi as its first Chief AI Officer, overseeing AI teams at the Government Digital Service. The hire from consumer tech (Product Director at Spotify Core Infrastructure, senior roles at Facebook) represents a significant departure from traditional government technology leadership.\n\nBacked by a 2 billion pound AI investment (2026-2030) with up to 137 million pounds for the AI Engineering Lab, the approach is distinctive for its time-limited vendor evaluation model. The Lab launches in early 2026 with time-limited licenses (up to 6 months) for Microsoft Copilot, Gemini, Amazon Q/Kiro, and Claude. The time-limited approach is intentional: it forces evaluation, prevents vendor lock-in, and enables comparison across platforms.\n\nThe Lab builds on existing AI deployments: the Ministry of Justice's ChatGPT Enterprise, and Whitehall AI tools 'Humphrey' and 'Consult.' The CoE model enables central evaluation and governance while individual government departments adapt AI to their specific domains.",
