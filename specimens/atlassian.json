The new Chief Product AND AI Officer role (Yehoshua) consolidates this further—one executive controls both the central AI platform and distributed product integration. This differs from M2 (pure CoE) because product teams have significant autonomy in how they apply AI, and from M6 because there is explicit central AI infrastructure and branding (Rovo). The ML Research team and Teamwork Lab suggest R&D capacity, but the primary structure is platform-serving-products, not standalone research.",

  "description": "Atlassian structures AI through a hybrid hub-and-spoke model where a central AI platform team builds shared infrastructure—the Teamwork Graph (100B+ objects) and a multi-model AI gateway—that product teams across Jira, Confluence, Rovo, and Loom consume. The November 2025 appointment of Tamar Yehoshua as Chief Product AND AI Officer consolidates both functions under a single C-level executive, signaling that AI is not a separate function but integrated into product development. CEO Mike Cannon-Brookes explicitly articulates this architecture: 'We built [our AI systems] to be multi-model on purpose... Our job is adopting and delivering value quickly.'\n\nThe rapid scaling of Rovo to 5 million monthly active users (up 43% from 3.5M in a single quarter) while improving gross margins demonstrates efficient platform deployment rather than experimental R&D sprawl. The company maintains separate research capacity through the ML Research team and Teamwork Lab (led by Dr. Molly Sands), but these appear to feed the platform rather than operate as independent research units. The ~$1B acquisition of The Browser Company (Dia browser) extends this platform strategy into the AI-native browser space for knowledge workers.\n\nCanon-Brookes's public framing positions AI as expanding rather than threatening software development: 'As software gets cheaper to build, the roadmap gets longer.' This suggests a temporal theory where AI lowers marginal cost of features, inducing demand for more features, which preserves or grows developer headcount. Virtual service agents resolving 22% of requests (returning ~1.5 FTE weekly in capacity) demonstrates execution-side deployment of AI for operational efficiency alongside exploration-side product innovation.",

This may represent an emerging M4 variant where the hub IS the product org rather than a separate AI team. Worth watching whether other companies adopt this combined title.",
    "[2026-02] Cannon-Brookes's claim 'as software gets cheaper to build, the roadmap gets longer' articulates a testable mechanism about induced demand. If true, AI doesn't threaten developer headcount because lower marginal cost of features induces demand for more features. This is an economic logic that could be studied empirically across firms.",
    "[2026-02] The scaling pattern (3.5M→5M Rovo users in one quarter while improving margins) suggests Atlassian has solved the AI infrastructure cost problem that plagues many M4 deployments. The 'multi-model on purpose' architecture may be key—central model selection reduces per-product experimentation costs. This efficiency story contrasts with companies where AI teams consume disproportionate compute budget."
