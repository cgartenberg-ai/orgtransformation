  "description": "Atlassian has built a sophisticated AI architecture around its proprietary Teamwork Graph — a knowledge graph mapping all organizational knowledge across teams, pull requests, work items, Confluence pages, Trello boards, and integrated third-party tools. The Graph populates both 'organically' (users linking objects) and 'inorganically' (system integrations).\n\nThe internal AI structure follows a hub-and-spoke model: product teams building AI features consult a centralized ML team, with an AI gateway proxy layer managing model selection and routing. Teams get 'complete free reign in the early days in discovery' before working with the ML team for optimization — a tiered exploration model.\n\nRovo agents represent the product output: AI teammates powered by the Teamwork Graph with identity, knowledge access, and autonomous action capability. The company has deliberately shifted PM hiring to recruit 'AI native' candidates.\n\nHead of AI Sherif Mansour frames enterprise AI deployment through 'Taste, Knowledge, Workflows' — the three ingredients: organizational character/voice, information agent access, and business process embedding.",
