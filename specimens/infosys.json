The dual-leadership structure—Sunil Senan for AI strategy/capability, Bali DR for AI deployment/service lines—reflects hub-and-spoke coordination. Secondary M2 reflects strong CoE characteristics: standards, enablement, governance (ISO 42001 certification), tiered training (270K 'AI Aware' certifications). Not M6 Portfolio because there's clear central coordination through Topaz, not autonomous parallel experiments.",

  "description": "Infosys structures AI through a hub-and-spoke model centered on its Topaz platform—a unified AI infrastructure comprising 12,000+ AI assets, 150+ pre-trained models, and 10+ specialized platforms. The hub provides standards, governance, and shared capability; the spokes include 12+ Living Labs globally, the London AI Lab (partnership with Cambridge), Cognition co-innovation labs (for Devin deployment), and specialized centers like the Cursor CoE.\n\nAI leadership is distributed across two EVP-level roles rather than a single CAIO: Sunil Senan (Global Head of Data and AI) owns AI-first strategy and portfolio, while Balakrishna 'Bali' DR (EVP, AI and Industry Verticals) drives AI adoption across service lines and internal operations. This matrix structure—one leader for capability, one for deployment—enables scaling AI across a 324K workforce while maintaining strategic coherence.\n\nThe organization follows a deliberate three-wave adoption strategy: Wave 1 (Nov 2022-24 months) focused on pilots and productivity; Wave 2 (current) addresses IT operations and business processes; Wave 3 (next 6-12 months) targets process and experience improvement. This measured rollout is reflected in metrics: 4,600 active AI projects with 90% of top 200 clients, 28M lines of AI-generated code, 500+ agents built, and workforce transformation evidenced by 12,506 headcount reduction alongside 20K planned FY27 hires.",

  "taxonomyFeedback": [
    "At 100,000 engineers, this is the largest announced CoE by headcount. Scale may change the CoE dynamics — governance at 100K is different from governance at 100.",
    "The dual purpose (internal enablement + client demo) blurs the line between CoE and product. The 'AI Engineering Experience Zone' is a sales tool.",
    "[2026-02] Infosys exhibits an interesting 'matrix hub-and-spoke' variant: the hub is not a single team but rather a platform (Topaz) combined with dual leadership roles that split strategy from deployment. This may warrant discussion of whether M4 should recognize platform-as-hub versus team-as-hub structures.",
    "[2026-02] The dual-leadership model (Senan for capability, Bali for deployment) represents a sophisticated organizational design for scaling AI across 324K employees. This contrasts with the single-CAIO model seen in many M4 specimens and may offer a template for very large enterprises where AI touches both internal operations and client delivery.",
    "[2026-02] The workforce recomposition pattern—12,506 headcount reduction paired with 20K new hires—combined with 270K employees being AI-certified suggests a full-workforce transformation rather than isolated AI teams. This blurs the M4/M6 boundary: is it hub-and-spoke governance, or is it enterprise-wide adoption (M6a) with strong central coordination? The three-wave strategy's explicit phasing tips toward M4, but this edge case merits tracking."
