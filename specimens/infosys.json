Cursor reports enterprises using its platform saw a 39% increase in shipped pull requests.\n\nThis represents the largest announced AI developer tools CoE by engineer count (100,000), making it a significant data point for the Model 2 pattern at massive scale.",

    "How does the Cursor CoE relate to Infosys's existing AI training programs (reported 250K employees trained on AI)?",

    "Is this primarily a marketing/sales partnership or a genuine structural transformation?",
    "How does this compare to TCS, Wipro, Accenture AI augmentation approaches?",
    "What is the internal org structure of the CoE? Dedicated team or distributed?"
  ],
  "taxonomyFeedback": [
    "At 100,000 engineers, this is the largest announced CoE by headcount. Scale may change the CoE dynamics — governance at 100K is different from governance at 100.",
    "The dual purpose (internal enablement + client demo) blurs the line between CoE and product. The 'AI Engineering Experience Zone' is a sales tool."
