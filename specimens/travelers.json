No evidence of spoke-level AI development capacity — business units are consumers, not co-developers. This is unidirectional enablement (central team builds, org consumes), which is M2 Center of Excellence, not M4 Hub-and-Spoke. Hub-and-spoke requires bidirectional flow with local AI teams adapting centrally-built capability. Confidence downgraded to Medium: we lack reporting structure details and cannot confirm whether spokes have any independent AI development capacity.

  "description": "Travelers, a $220B market cap property and casualty insurer, has built TravAI — an in-house agentic AI platform integrating multiple frontier models with internal systems. Over 30,000 employees have access to the platform, with 20,000+ using AI tools regularly. Dozens of scaled generative AI tools are in production across underwriting, claims, and engineering.\n\nThe structural arrangement is hub-and-spoke: TravAI serves as the central platform (hub) that builds and deploys AI tools, while business functions — underwriting, claims processing, and engineering — operate as spokes that consume these tools in their daily workflows. A parallel Anthropic partnership gives 10,000 engineers, data scientists, and analysts integrated Claude AI assistance. The company has invested $1.5B in technology from 2016-2025.\n\nConcrete operational impact is visible across multiple functions. Claims processing has been restructured: 30% reduction in call center staffing, consolidation from 4 call centers to 2, AI voice agent handling first notice of loss, 50%+ of claims eligible for straight-through processing (66% customer adoption), and 90% of catastrophe claims closed within 30 days. In underwriting, generative AI consolidates data into actionable summaries, yielding a 30% reduction in average handle time for renewal underwriting. CEO Alan Schnitzer frames this as domain expertise amplification: AI makes insurance experts more effective rather than replacing them.",
