  "description": "Recursion represents a distinctive case where the entire company IS an AI research lab. Rather than having an AI unit within a pharmaceutical company, Recursion was built from inception as an automated drug discovery platform. Robots run up to 2.2 million experiments weekly, generating 40 petabytes of data from over 300 million experiments.\n\nThe company inverts traditional pharmaceutical research by adopting a hypothesis-free approach. Traditional pharma starts with hypotheses about disease mechanisms; Recursion's platform finds novel biology that may have been overlooked by humans or considered too challenging to pursue. LOWE, an LLM-based interface, allows scientists to query across animal models, commercially available compounds, and existing research using natural language.\n\nThe vision extends from a 'self-driving lab' toward building a 'virtual cell' and eventually virtual organ and virtual patient. By leveraging data, automation, and virtual modeling, Recursion develops lead molecules with claimed 10x the efficiency of traditional methods, in half the time and at a fraction of the cost.",
