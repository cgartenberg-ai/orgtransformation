  "description": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has executed one of the most dramatic organizational transformations in big tech: restructuring executive ranks while demanding that all leaders 'work and act like Individual Contributors in our own orgs, constantly learning and unlearning.'\n\nNadella describes a three-tier AI structure: (1) Infrastructure/token factory (Azure compute), (2) Agent factory (platform for building AI agents), (3) Systems of intelligence / Copilot family (first-party AI products). Each layer should be independently usable but with 'integration benefits and platform effects' — a deliberate structural choice about modularity vs. bundling.\n\nNadella manages Microsoft's massive org through 'micro-cultures' rather than top-down directives: 'The power is a lot more diffused and distributed... Micro-cultures and they can be shaped.' He stays connected to innovation by 'lingering around Teams channels' — discovering emerging AI work organically. As he puts it, 'Teams is the new wandering the halls.'\n\nMicrosoft is expanding into vertical AI domains: DAX Copilot for physician note-taking (health), NLWeb for agentic commerce (in collaboration with Stripe). The framing of AI's core enterprise challenge: 'Making sure that AI is getting diffused inside of the enterprise... not to just admire somebody else's AI factory or AI agent, but how to build your own.'",
