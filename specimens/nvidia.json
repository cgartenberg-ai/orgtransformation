  "description": "A model where the 'lab' is essentially the entire company operating with complete information transparency—no separate innovation function because innovation is expected everywhere.\n- CEO Jensen Huang manages 60 direct reports with no one-on-one meetings\n- 'All NVIDIA execs should be able to learn from the feedback he provides to any one of them'\n- Instead of private meetings, Huang prefers mass gatherings where he reasons through decisions aloud\n- Every morning, Huang reads about 100 'Top Five Things' emails from employees across the company—summaries of what each person wants leadership to know\n- Uses these to 'stochastically sample the system' and sense whether the company is moving in the right direction\n- No long-term or short-term plans: 'the company adopts a flexible approach, constantly re-evaluating based on ever-evolving business conditions'\n\nInternally, NVIDIA engineers use AI coding assistants (Cursor) 'pervasively.' Jensen frames AI's role through a 'purpose vs. tasks' lens: the purpose of a software engineer is to solve problems; coding is just one task. This philosophy drives how NVIDIA deploys AI internally — not replacing roles but redefining what roles do. Jensen argues productivity gains should lead to exploring more ideas and growth, not headcount reduction, and NVIDIA continues aggressive hiring despite AI productivity gains.",
