    "classificationRationale": "CAIO role sits within ITS (Information Technology Services) and focuses on governance, policy, training, and enablement — hallmarks of M2 (Center of Excellence). The CAIO is not building AI products but enabling AI adoption across state agencies through acceptable use policies, training pilots (1,000 employees), and infrastructure (Empire AI consortium). Contextual orientation assigned because the goal is agency-wide AI adoption with employees expected to integrate AI into existing roles, not structural separation of an explore unit. Low confidence because (a) structural detail beyond the CAIO role is very thin, (b) we don't know the CAIO's team size, budget, or decision authority, and (c) the rapid turnover (2nd CAIO in <1 year) suggests the role may not yet be institutionally stable enough to classify firmly.",

  "description": "New York State appointed Eleonore Fournier-Tombs as its second Chief AI Officer (CAIO) on January 9, 2026, replacing Shreya Amin who departed after less than one year for 'personal and professional reasons, including the launch of her new company.' The rapid turnover — two CAIOs in under a year — raises questions about role stability in government AI leadership.\n\nFournier-Tombs brings an academic and international policy background: 15+ years in tech innovation, founder of the UN University's first AI policy research lab, and leader of anticipatory action and governance for predictive analytics in crisis forecasting. This represents a distinct CAIO pipeline — academic/international to government — contrasting with the corporate-to-corporate and military-to-government pipelines documented in other specimens.\n\nThe CAIO's priorities include expanding AI tools for state employees, refining the 'Acceptable Use of AI Technologies' policy, and building on an AI education pilot that trained approximately 1,000 state employees across multiple agencies. Empire AI, a statewide supercomputing consortium for university AI research launched by Governor Hochul, provides infrastructure. New York is part of a broader wave of state-level CAIO appointments alongside Oklahoma, Montana, Texas, North Carolina, Arkansas, and Illinois.",

    "New York State is a Stub specimen — thin on structural detail but valuable as one of the first state-government AI governance specimens. The CAIO role in government may be structurally different from corporate CAIO roles: more governance/policy, less product/technical.",
    "CAIO turnover (<1 year tenure for first appointee) is a potentially important signal about government CAIO role stability. Worth tracking across other state-level CAIOs (OK, MT, TX, NC, AR, IL).",
    "The academic/international-to-government CAIO pipeline (Fournier-Tombs: UN University -> NY State) is distinct from the corporate-to-corporate pipelines documented elsewhere. May be a government-specific variant worth noting in Mechanism #9 (Hire CAIOs).",
    "[2026-02] Overnight scan added one additional press source but no new structural data. Specimen remains a Stub — need deeper sources (budget docs, org charts, legislative testimony) to move beyond surface-level CAIO appointment coverage."
