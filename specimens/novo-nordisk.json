  "description": "Novo Nordisk's Enterprise AI organization represents a mature hub-and-spoke model with a 300-person central AI team that enables capabilities across the pharmaceutical giant. Under CAIO Mads Einar Krogh Kristensen (since 2023), the company has deployed Microsoft Copilot to 20,000 employees under the banner 'Make Your Time Count' — signaling that AI adoption is about productivity enhancement, not workforce reduction.\n\nThe central 300-person Enterprise AI team serves as the hub, providing platforms, governance, and expertise. Spoke teams embedded in business units apply AI to specific domains including GLP-1 drug optimization and clinical trials. The mass deployment strategy — giving 20,000 employees Copilot access with clear productivity messaging — combines structural AI capability building with broad contextual adoption.\n\nThe CAIO reports to executive leadership, ensuring AI has board-level visibility and strategic alignment. This structure allows Novo Nordisk to maintain long-horizon drug discovery AI research while simultaneously deploying productivity tools across the enterprise.",
