  "description": "AMI Labs (Advanced Machine Intelligence Labs) was founded by Yann LeCun (Turing Award winner, age 65) after departing Meta in November 2025, where he served as Chief AI Scientist for 12 years. His departure was triggered by tension with Alexandr Wang over reporting lines within Meta's newly consolidated MSL structure.\n\nLeCun took the role of Executive Chair (not CEO), citing his temperament and age: 'I'm too disorganized for this, and also too old.' CEO is Alex LeBrun. The lab focuses on 'world models' \u2014 AI that understands physics, maintains persistent memory, and plans complex actions \u2014 using V-JEPA architecture as an explicit rejection of the dominant LLM approach.\n\nFundraising targets approximately \u20ac500M at a \u20ac3-3.5B valuation, one of the largest pre-launch AI raises ever. Meta continues a partnership despite LeCun's departure (non-compete apparently not enforced). AMI Labs also established a partnership with Nabla (healthcare) for 'first access' to world model tech, targeting FDA-certifiable agentic AI. 'Baby' versions of world models expected within 1 year; full-scale systems in a few years. HQ in Paris (planned early 2026).",
