  "description": "AMI Labs was founded by Yann LeCun (Turing Award winner, age 65) after departing Meta in Jan 2026, where he served as Chief AI Scientist for 12 years. LeCun took the role of Executive Chair (not CEO), citing his temperament and age. CEO is Alex LeBrun. The lab focuses on 'world models' — AI that understands physics, memory, and planning — using V-JEPA architecture as an alternative to the dominant LLM paradigm. Seeking approximately 500M euros at a 3-3.5B euro valuation. Meta will not invest but plans a partnership. HQ in Paris.",
