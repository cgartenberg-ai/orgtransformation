  "description": "Roche's gRED Computational Sciences group pioneered the 'Lab in a Loop' concept — integrating computational prediction with wet lab validation in tight cycles. Rather than treating AI as a separate function, the model creates a continuous feedback loop where in silico predictions drive wet lab experiments, and experimental results improve the models.\n\nThe Prescient Design acquisition brought dedicated AI protein design capabilities, complementing internal computational sciences. The $12B commitment to computational sciences signals the scale of investment in this research-first approach.\n\nThe structural arrangement maintains the computational sciences group as a distinct research entity within Roche's broader R&D organization (gRED), while requiring tight integration with wet lab teams. This creates a productive tension between computational exploration and experimental validation.",
