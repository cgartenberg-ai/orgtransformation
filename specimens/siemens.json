  "description": "Siemens CEO Roland Busch positions AI as 'the operating system for the industrial sector,' presenting a vision at CES 2026 alongside NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang. The company made a key structural hire: Vasi Philomin, former AWS VP of Generative AI who launched Amazon Bedrock, was appointed EVP and Head of Data & AI in July 2025.\n\nPhilomin's thesis is that 'the next great frontier for artificial intelligence is the physical world — powering machines, factories, and infrastructure that sense, reason, and act.' The flagship transformation is Siemens' device plant in Erlangen, set to become the world's first fully AI-controlled, adaptive manufacturing facility.\n\nThe Xcelerator platform integrates AI as a foundational capability across digital twins, automation, and manufacturing, with 35 AI-powered applications including the award-winning Industrial Copilot. Siemens' data advantage thesis argues that proprietary industrial data positions Germany uniquely for the AI era.",
