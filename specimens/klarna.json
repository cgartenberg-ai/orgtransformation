They publicly reversed course after going 'full tilt toward AI-based support.'\n- February 2024: AI assistant announced as 'doing the equivalent work of 700 full-time agents' within first month\n- Initial results: 2.3 million conversations, matching human satisfaction scores\n- 25% drop in repeat inquiries, resolution time dropped from 11 minutes to under 2 minutes\n- $40 million annual savings projected; workforce shrank 40% from 5,000 to ~3,000\n- By 2025, Klarna reversed course, resuming human hiring after acknowledging 'a full tilt toward AI-based support roles resulted in lower quality work'\n- New model: Hybrid approach with AI handling simple inquiries, humans handling nuance and complexity",

Klarna did not create a named AI unit—the CEO drove enterprise-wide AI adoption directly, replacing 700 agents with AI, then reversed course. This is the informal, top-down adoption pattern of Model 6a. Contextual orientation confirmed: no named AI structure, CEO-driven cultural mandate. Fixed industry from Technology to Fintech. Removed weak Mechanism #5 (the pattern here is not deploy-before-knowing; it is CEO-mandated rapid adoption followed by correction). Added habitat data. This specimen is valuable as a CAUTIONARY case—demonstrates limits of pure AI substitution.",
