  "description": "US Cyber Command named Reid Novotny as its first Chief AI Officer, tasked with accelerating AI adoption across cyber operations. Novotny brings 24+ years of service in the US Air Force and Maryland Air National Guard, spanning intelligence, cyber defense, and policy. This appointment follows the White House OMB mandate (March 2024) requiring all executive departments to appoint a CAIO within 60 days.\n\nThe military-to-CAIO career pipeline is a distinct pattern: operational experience in intelligence and cyber defense provides domain expertise that academic or commercial AI leaders typically lack. The CAIO role at Cyber Command represents the formalization of AI governance within the defense establishment.",
