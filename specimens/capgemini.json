Likely exists but not described. The EUR 700M restructuring is for 'country-specific workforce and skills adaptation initiatives' — suggesting distributed, country-level AI adoption rather than centralized lab. GenAI/agentic AI accounts for 10%+ of Group bookings (already enterprise-wide). M6a: mass adoption without formal named AI structure. Low confidence: single corporate announcement source. Contextual orientation: 'enterprise-wide AI adoption' suggests same people doing both traditional and AI work.",

  "description": "Capgemini announced EUR 700 million in restructuring charges over 2025-2026 (majority in 2026) for 'country-specific workforce and skills adaptation initiatives' to meet surging AI demand. CEO Aiman Ezzat framed this as 'clearly pivoting the Group to be the catalyst for enterprise-wide AI adoption.'\n\nGenerative and agentic AI already accounted for over 10% of Group bookings in Q4 2025, indicating substantial market traction. Expected restructuring cash outflows run approximately EUR 200M above 2025 levels. The 340,000-employee organization faces the classic professional services AI tension: restructuring human expertise while selling that same expertise to clients.\n\nThe 'catalyst' framing is noteworthy — Ezzat positions Capgemini not as an AI adopter but as the entity that enables other organizations' AI transformations, justifying internal restructuring as necessary to credibly deliver AI services externally.",

    "[2026-02] The 'catalyst for enterprise-wide AI adoption' framing creates a recursive tension: Capgemini sells AI transformation services while undergoing its own AI transformation. This is the professional services paradox — the product is human expertise, but the restructuring reduces human headcount.",
