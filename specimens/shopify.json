  "description": "Shopify represents one of the clearest examples of contextual ambidexterity: CEO Tobi Lütke mandated that employees must 'show jobs can't be done by artificial intelligence before asking for more headcount and resources.' Rather than creating a separate AI lab, Shopify embedded AI capability expectations into every role — making AI proficiency a condition of employment and resource allocation.\n\nAI usage is now a 'baseline expectation' that influences performance reviews. Lütke expects employees to use AI as 'a thought partner, deep researcher, critic, tutor, or pair programmer.' Developers have access to Copilot, Cursor, and Claude Code 'all pre-tooled and ready to go.' AI integration is formally part of monthly business reviews and product development cycles.\n\nThe approach extends to products: Shopify Magic and Sidekick externalize this AI-first philosophy to merchants. The Winter 2025 'RenAIssance edition' contained 150+ AI-focused product updates. By Winter 2026, Shopify introduced 'Agentic Storefronts' — making every store agent-ready by default. Headcount dropped from 8,300 to 8,100 over the past year while output increased.",
