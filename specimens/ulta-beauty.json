Orientation is Contextual because AI is being embedded throughout the organization—associates use scheduling tools, supply chain uses ML optimization, marketing uses personalization—rather than exploration being isolated in a separate unit. The CDO's quote about AI enabling 'more human connection' and CEO's 'way of being' framing both emphasize contextual integration over structural separation.",

  "description": "Ulta Beauty has established a formal AI Center of Excellence under Chief Technology and Transformation Officer Mike Maresca, bringing together AI/ML engineers from across the organization into a central hub. This hub develops capabilities and standards that are then deployed across business functions—supply chain optimization, payroll and scheduling tools for associates, and personalization engines for marketing. The company's 'Ulta Beauty Unleashed' strategy positions AI as central to transformation, with CEO Kecia Steelman emphasizing it as 'a way of being' rather than an isolated initiative.\n\nThe organization operates with dual technology leadership: CTTO Maresca owns the AI Center of Excellence and broader technology modernization (including the multi-year Project SOAR SAP implementation), while CDO Prama Bhatt leads digital innovation including consumer-facing AI applications like GlamLab virtual try-on and the Quazi decisioning platform. This creates a hub-and-spoke structure where central AI capability development feeds distributed application across channels.\n\nUlta has also established Prisma Ventures as a corporate venture arm investing in AI startups (Haut.ai, Adeptmind, Iterate.ai), providing an external innovation lens. The company is actively developing agentic AI capabilities for 2026 deployment, currently evaluating whether to deploy a unified AI assistant versus specialized agents—a decision that will shape their future structural model.",

    "[2026-02] Ulta Beauty presents a clean M4 case with an interesting dual-head structure: CTTO owns the AI Center of Excellence (capability development) while CDO owns digital innovation (consumer-facing applications). This creates potential coordination challenges but also allows specialized focus—a variant worth tracking as more retailers split AI leadership this way.",
    "[2026-02] The 'way of being' framing from CEO Steelman is notable for a contextual orientation—it explicitly frames AI not as a separate initiative but as embedded in organizational culture. This rhetoric aligns with contextual ambidexterity theory (Gibson & Birkinshaw) where the organization develops behavioral capacity for both exploration and exploitation rather than structural separation.",
    "[2026-02] The agentic AI decision point (unified assistant vs. specialized agents) represents a live structural choice that could shift the model. If they choose specialized agents deployed to different functions, it reinforces M4; if they choose a unified assistant, it could push toward M2 with stronger central control. Worth tracking in future layers."
