  "description": "Salesforce is the cleanest case study of a company simultaneously building AI products, using those products to restructure its own workforce, and selling the restructuring capability to others. Agentforce serves 18,500 enterprise customers with 9,500 paid deals and $500M ARR (Q3 FY2026), running 3 billion automated workflows monthly.\n\nInternally, Salesforce deployed Agentforce on help.salesforce.com, handling 380,000 conversations at an 84% autonomous resolution rate with only 2% escalation to humans. This enabled 4,000 support jobs to be cut in September 2025, with staff redeployed into sales and services roles \u2014 what Benioff calls 'radical augmentation.' The workforce composition shifted: 20%+ more AEs hired, engineering headcount flat, AI budget tripled from $4M to $300M.\n\nThe $8B Informatica acquisition provides the data management foundation for Agentforce's enterprise AI pipeline. The launch of AgentExchange \u2014 'the world's first agent marketplace' targeting a '$6 trillion digital labor market' \u2014 marks an identity-level shift from CRM company to 'digital labor' platform company. Data Cloud + AI ARR reached $900M (+120% YoY). Dual AI leadership: Agentforce product teams + Eric Hysen as Chief AI & Transformation Officer (ex-DHS CAIO).",

The eat-your-own-dog-food pattern with specific metrics (84% resolution, 2% escalation, $500M ARR) is unusually well-documented.",
