  "description": "Approximately 15 years ago, Eli Lilly decentralized its R&D into smaller hubs of 300-400 people. Each hub operates like an internal biotech — focused on a specific therapeutic area or modality — but without the burden of fundraising or quarterly investor pressure. The hubs are small enough to maintain scientific intimacy and shared tacit knowledge, yet large enough to have critical mass of capability.\n\nThe structure enables extraordinarily long time horizons. The GLP-1 program ran 18+ years from first injection in 2006 to the launch of Mounjaro, with teams 'just grinding on a theme' rather than making big-bet single projects. CEO Dave Ricks explicitly shields these hubs from corporate optimization pressure, recognizing that middle management naturally squashes the off-strategy deviations that produce breakthroughs.\n\nIn January 2026, Lilly added a new dimension: a $1B co-innovation lab with NVIDIA in South San Francisco. This 'scientist-in-the-loop' AI capability co-locates Lilly domain experts with NVIDIA AI engineers, creating a continuous learning system connecting agentic wet labs with computational dry labs for 24/7 AI-assisted experimentation. The lab will also deploy a 1,016 Blackwell Ultra GPU supercomputer — the most powerful owned by a pharma company.",
