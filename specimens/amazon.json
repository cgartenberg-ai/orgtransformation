  "description": "Amazon's January 2026 restructuring represents AI-driven workforce transformation at unprecedented scale. The company cut 16,000 corporate jobs (its second wave in three months after 14,000 in October 2025), with projections reaching 30,000 by May 2026. CEO Andy Jassy framed the cuts as cultural rather than financial: removing 'layers of bureaucracy' and 'increasing ownership.'\n\nThis occurs against a backdrop of record financial performance (Q4 profits up ~40% to ~$21B) and the highest AI capital expenditure among megacap companies ($125B forecast for 2026). The $100B AI investment is explicitly linked to the layoff decisions — this is strategic rebalancing, not distress.\n\nNote: This specimen captures Amazon's enterprise-wide AI-driven restructuring. The separate amazon-agi specimen covers Amazon's AGI research lab and Bedrock/AWS AI platform organizational structure.",
