  "description": "Wells Fargo named Saul Van Beurden as Head of AI (Nov 2025). Van Beurden was previously CEO of Consumer and Small Business Banking — a business leader, not a consumer technologist. He continues in a dual role as co-CEO of Consumer Banking. Background: joined WF in 2019 as head of technology, previously CIO at JPMorgan Chase. Wells Fargo also hired Faraz Shafiq from AWS as Head of AI Products (Feb 2026). The bank has trained 90,000 employees and deployed AI tools to 180,000 desktops. CEO Charlie Scharf has framed AI as a competitive imperative across all industries. In late 2025, Wells Fargo partnered with Google Cloud on agentic AI via Google Agentspace, deploying Deep Research and NotebookLM to ~2,000 employees. Tracy Kerrins serves as Head of Consumer Technology and Generative AI, overseeing a dual-track platform strategy. The bank has set a 30-35% automation target for engineering and admin tasks as part of restructuring.",

Tracy Kerrins role as 'Head of Consumer Technology and Generative AI' suggests functional specialization within the AI organization.
