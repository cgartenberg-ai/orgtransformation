  "description": "Kyndryl, the IT infrastructure services company spun off from IBM in 2021, organizes AI work through a practice-based model rather than a centralized AI unit. Five Global Practices form the organizational backbone: Applications, Data and AI (Michael Bradshaw), Cloud (Nicolas Sekkaki), Core Enterprise and zCloud (Hassan Zamat), Cyber Security and Resiliency, Network and Edge (Paul Savill), and Digital Workplace (Ivan Dopple). The Applications, Data and AI practice — created through a July 2024 leadership reshuffle that moved Bradshaw from CIO to practice leader (swapping roles with Sekkaki) — functions as the Center of Excellence for AI capability, setting standards, building the AgenTeq agentic AI framework, and providing methodology across customer engagements.\n\nKyndryl Bridge is the AI-powered IT management platform serving 1,200+ customers with 190 services, functioning as the operational backbone rather than a separate AI team. A cross-functional governance committee evaluates and approves AI use cases for regulatory and risk alignment. AI Innovation Labs in Liverpool and Singapore provide prototyping capability. Kyndryl Consult (SVP Ismail Amla) delivers agentic AI organizational change management services. The alliance-driven agent development model is distinctive: 100 AI agents built in 100 days with Google Cloud, plus deep partnerships with Microsoft (16,000+ employees with 26,000+ certifications), NVIDIA, SAP, and AWS.\n\nThe company is financially profitable but under significant pressure. Revenue is declining in constant currency, the stock plunged ~25% after Q3 FY2026 results missed estimates (February 2026), and interim appointments for CFO and General Counsel signal leadership instability. Headcount has declined from ~90,000 at the 2021 IBM spinoff to ~60,000. However, AI is the growth story: 25% of new contracts include AI-related services, hyperscaler revenue hit $500M/quarter (+58% YoY), and the Consult practice grew 24%. CEO Martin Schroeter (former IBM CFO) frames Kyndryl as the bridge between line-of-business AI ambitions and CIO/CTO operational realities — positioning the company at the infrastructure layer of enterprise AI adoption.",

  "openQuestions": [
    "How much of Kyndryl's AI work is internal transformation vs. customer-facing delivery — and does the taxonomy need to distinguish these?",
    "What is the cross-functional governance committee's actual composition and how frequently does it meet?",
    "How has the Bradshaw CIO→AI practice swap affected internal AI capability — did bringing operational CIO experience to the AI practice change how they deliver?",
    "What is the financial trajectory for AI-inclusive contracts — will the 25% grow fast enough to offset declining legacy infrastructure revenue?",
    "How does the IBM spinoff heritage (mainframe expertise, large enterprise relationships) shape the specific AI use cases Kyndryl pursues vs. born-in-cloud competitors?"
  ],

  "taxonomyFeedback": [
    "[2026-02] Kyndryl is primarily a services company — their AI structure is about enabling CLIENT AI transformations, not their own. This raises an important taxonomy question: should IT services firms be classified by their internal AI structure or their client delivery model? The collection may need a 'services firm' habitat tag to distinguish these.",
    "[2026-02] The July 2024 Bradshaw/Sekkaki swap (CIO→AI practice leader, AI practice leader→Cloud) is a telling structural signal: Schroeter wanted operational CIO experience applied to AI commercialization. This is a deliberate capability-matching move, not just a reshuffle.",
    "[2026-02] The alliance-driven agent development model (100 agents in 100 days with Google Cloud, partnerships with Microsoft/NVIDIA/SAP) is structurally distinctive — Kyndryl builds AI capabilities through partnerships rather than internal R&D. This is neither M1 (research) nor M3 (embedded) but a partner-mediated CoE model.",
    "[2026-02] The simultaneous financial pressure (stock -25%, guidance cut, interim CFO) and AI growth story (hyperscaler +58%, 25% of contracts) creates a classic ambidexterity tension: the legacy business is shrinking while the AI business is growing. Whether the company can survive the transition depends on the speed of the crossover.",
    "[2026-02] IBM heritage is visible in the practice-based organizational structure, mainframe expertise (Agentic AI Framework for Mainframe launched Feb 2026), and large enterprise customer base. The IBM connection is both asset (relationships, domain knowledge) and liability (association with legacy infrastructure)."
