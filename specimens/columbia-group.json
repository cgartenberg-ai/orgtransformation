Orfanidou previously served as Head of AI Services at Deloitte Cyprus and led AI adoption for the European Commission. She plans to establish an 'AI factory' for developing customized solutions, with initial focus on internal operations: AI agents for repetitive tasks, knowledge management tools, and modernized crew assignment systems.
