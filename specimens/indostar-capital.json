This suggests a centralized AI leadership role coordinating across business functions — consistent with Model 2 (CoE). However, no formal CoE team or separate AI unit is described; the CAIO may be a single-leader governance role rather than a staffed center. Low confidence: limited structural detail beyond the C-suite appointment.",

  "description": "IndoStar Capital Finance, an Indian NBFC backed by Brookfield and Everstone, restructured its senior management in January 2026 by re-designating CTO Amit Kothari to Chief AI Officer and appointing a new CTO (Shivam Choudhary) to backfill. This CTO-to-CAIO career pipeline is a notable variant of Mechanism #9.\n\nKothari's CAIO mandate extends beyond deploying AI tools: the role involves embedding intelligent decision-making into core lending engines, risk management frameworks, and scalable digital architectures, with emphasis on responsible AI adoption. With 28+ years of experience including 7+ years as CTO at digital lending NBFCs, Kothari brings deep domain expertise to the AI transformation.\n\nIndoStar operates 500+ branches nationwide serving 100K+ customers across commercial vehicles, construction equipment, farm equipment, and small business loans. The re-designation signals that AI leadership is now considered distinct from and more strategically important than general technology leadership.",
