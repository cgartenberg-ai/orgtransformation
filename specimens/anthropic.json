  "description": "Anthropic operates a two-part innovation model: (1) a dedicated Labs team focused on 'disruptive zero-to-one ideas' that operates independently from core product, and (2) a company-wide product philosophy of 'ride the exponential' — building for capabilities that don't exist yet. Labs built Claude CLI (later Claude Code), early computer use explorations, and other experimental bets.\n\nThe company's leadership structure explicitly maps to the explore/execute tension: CEO Dario Amodei handles strategy and vision (exploration), while COO Daniela Amodei handles operations (execution). Dario describes this split as allowing 'each to spend most of our time on the thing that we're best at.'\n\nAnthropically, the 7 co-founder structure with equal equity is distinctive. All 7 co-founders share equity equally — defying standard Silicon Valley advice. This works because they had long histories of working together, and having 7 value-carriers allows the organization to scale while maintaining cultural coherence. Dario holds regular all-hands 'every couple of weeks' to maintain mission alignment across the growing org.\n\nAnthropically operates as a Public Benefit Corporation with a unique Long-Term Benefit Trust (LTBT) holding special Class T shares with escalating board-election rights. This governance structure protects the safety mission from short-term market pressures. The company is preparing for IPO (Wilson Sonsini hired, $350B+ valuation range) with a novel single-class common stock structure where the LTBT provides governance center of gravity rather than dual-class founder shares.",
