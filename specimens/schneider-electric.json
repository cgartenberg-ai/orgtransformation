  "description": "Schneider Electric operates an explicitly named hub-and-spoke AI model, with an AI Hub established in 2021 under CAIO Philippe Rambach. The hub provides governance, develops data science expertise, and collaborates with business units on deployment. The operating model is designed to break down silos and ensure cohesive flow across the organization.\n\nBacked by more than 2.5 billion euros in AI investment through 2027, Schneider's three-layer strategy covers internal productivity, product augmentation, and new value creation. Agentic AI is being deployed for industrial applications, making factory processes more intelligent through autonomous decisions. The company processes 7.5 million customer service tickets annually, with AI now auto-routing previously manual requests.\n\nThe vision extends to sustainability: Rambach states that 'energy transition will not happen without AI,' positioning Schneider's AI capability as essential to both industrial efficiency and climate goals. The target is 6 billion euros in software and services revenue by the early 2030s.",
