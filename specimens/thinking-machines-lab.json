  "description": "Founded by former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati after her departure in September 2025, Thinking Machines Lab focuses on making AI models more efficient and customizable — positioning as an alternative to the 'scale is all you need' approach. The startup raised a $2B seed round at $12B valuation within its first 5 months, one of the largest seed rounds in Silicon Valley history.\n\nThe company launched Tinker, a tool that simplifies fine-tuning open models using techniques like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation). This product commercializes the research thesis that smaller, customized models can outperform larger general-purpose ones for specific applications.\n\nThe team includes other former OpenAI researchers, reflecting the AI talent diaspora pattern where researchers leave large labs to pursue alternative approaches. The efficiency-first thesis directly challenges the scaling paradigm that dominated Murati's former employer.",
