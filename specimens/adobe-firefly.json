Edge case: Firefly augments existing products rather than creating standalone ventures — could argue for Model 3 (Embedded Teams) if Firefly teams are now embedded in product orgs. Structural orientation: Firefly development was ring-fenced from core product teams.",

Decision tree walk: formal AI unit (Firefly team) → not primarily academic research → central team builds products → outputs are new products staying in parent (Firefly integrated into Photoshop, Illustrator, etc.) → 5a. Noted edge case: Firefly augments existing products rather than creating standalone ventures, which could argue for Model 3 (Embedded). Kept 5a because Firefly was incubated as a distinct product initiative. Fixed habitat fields. Removed weak Mechanism #1 evidence.",
