Google X as AI incubator (2009, Thrun's academic consultant model). Brain team (2011, Dean/Ng/Corrado). DNN Research acquisition ($44M, Hinton/Krizhevsky/Sutskever). DeepMind acquisition ($550M, 2014) kept operationally separate in London with independent oversight board. Dual structure (Brain = products, DeepMind = AGI research) preserved mission integrity but may have delayed ChatGPT response. Talent exodus: Rosewood Hotel dinner (2015) → Sutskever → OpenAI.
