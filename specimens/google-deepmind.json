    "The analyst narrative shift — 'from an advertising giant that uses AI to an AI company that monetizes through advertising' — represents an identity-level structural reframing. If this narrative takes hold internally, it could drive reclassification: Google DeepMind shifts from a research lab within an ad company to the core capability of an AI company. This blurs the M1/M4 boundary further.",
    "Cloud backlog at $155B and 34% growth suggests enterprise AI is becoming a core revenue driver for Alphabet, not a side bet. This changes the structural relationship between DeepMind (research) and Cloud (commercialization) — the research-to-product pipeline is now a major revenue pipeline.",
    "[2026-02] The '50% of code AI-generated' finding is a major structural marker. If AI agents write half the code with human review, this fundamentally changes the labor model of software production. Google is not just building AI — they are being transformed by it internally. This is a strong signal for the 'AI-native organization' pattern we're tracking. However, unclear if this applies to DeepMind specifically or just Google overall.",
    "[2026-02] CapEx nearly doubling ($91B → $175-185B) while Pichai expects supply constraints all year suggests demand is outrunning even aggressive capacity buildout. This is infrastructure-level commitment that locks in the AI-centric strategy for years. Cloud backlog at $240B (+55% QoQ) confirms enterprise demand is real.",
