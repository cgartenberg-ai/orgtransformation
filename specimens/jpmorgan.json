  "taxonomyFeedback": [
    "[2026-02] JPMorgan's M4 structure reveals an unusual hybrid between Model 2 (Center of Excellence) and Model 4 (Hub-and-Spoke) that challenges the taxonomy's clean boundaries. The ML CoE functions simultaneously as a platform distributor (classic M4) AND as a governance/standards body (classic M2). The 8-week iteration cadence suggests the CoE retains product ownership of the LLM Suite itself, rather than merely enabling business units to build their own AI products—this is more centralized than typical M4 specimens where spokes have greater autonomy. The taxonomy may need a more explicit way to capture 'platform-as-product' variants where the hub doesn't just enable but actively operates the AI infrastructure.",
    "[2026-02] The regulatory intensity contingency creates an economically fascinating paradox: JPMorgan achieves 8-week deployment cycles in one of the most heavily regulated industries (banking), while many tech companies with minimal regulatory constraints move slower. This suggests regulatory pressure may actually accelerate centralization as a coordination mechanism—when compliance costs are high, the transaction costs of distributed AI experimentation become prohibitive, making the M4 hub-and-spoke structure not just viable but economically necessary. This inverts the usual assumption that regulation slows innovation; instead, regulation may force structural choices that enable speed through reduced coordination costs.",
    "[2026-02] The exclusion of 'branch and call center staff' from the 250K LLM Suite deployment is a structurally revealing choice that exposes a tacit organizational theory. These are the employees with highest customer contact and potentially highest value from AI augmentation, yet they're systematically excluded—likely due to compliance risk, liability concerns, or assumptions about capability/training. This suggests JPMorgan's M4 structure has an implicit boundary: AI for knowledge workers (internal efficiency) but not for customer-facing operations (external risk). This contradicts the stated vision of 'AI concierges for every client experience' and may indicate a temporal staging strategy where internal deployment precedes customer-facing deployment, or a deeper structural tension between AI ambition and risk management that the current M4 model cannot resolve.",
    "[2026-02] Q4 2025 earnings reveal that JPMorgan 'took AI, slash data, out of technology' — a deliberate structural separation that strengthens the M4 classification. This is not just a CoE within Technology; it's a distinct organizational function with its own C-suite leadership. This suggests JPMorgan has moved beyond the typical M4 hub-and-spoke to something closer to Model 6 (Parallel Dual Structure) — a formal AI organization operating alongside the core Technology org. However, since the AI function appears to serve the entire enterprise rather than operating as an autonomous unit, M4 remains the better fit. The structural separation may be JPMorgan's solution to the taxonomy's noted M2/M4 ambiguity: by separating AI from Technology, they clarify that AI is not merely a support function (M2) but an enterprise-serving capability hub (M4).",
    "[2026-02] Dimon's competitive framing ('Your competitors include all the FinTech. You have Stripe, you have SoFi, you have Revolut') reveals the economic logic driving JPMorgan's AI structural choices. The bank isn't just competing with other banks; it's competing with digital-native firms that have no legacy technology debt. This competitive pressure may explain why JPMorgan achieves faster deployment cycles than many tech companies — the transaction costs of NOT moving fast (competitive displacement) outweigh the transaction costs of rapid centralized deployment. This is a contingency factor worth tracking: competitive intensity from digital-native entrants may drive incumbents toward more aggressive AI structuring."
