The Oct 2025 restructuring consolidated Meta's AI into a 4-unit Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL) under Alexandr Wang: (1) TBD Lab (LLMs), (2) FAIR (long-term research), (3) Products & Applied Research, (4) MSL Infra. This is a classic hub-and-spoke with MSL as the hub and 4 specialized units as spokes. FAIR retains as secondary Model 1 element but is now subordinated to product-driven leadership. The departure of chief scientist LeCun signals that pure research autonomy was sacrificed for product coordination. High confidence: 8+ sources with detailed structural information.",

  "description": "Meta reorganized its AI division into Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL) with 4 units: (1) TBD Lab (LLMs including Llama), (2) FAIR (long-term research), (3) Products & Applied Research (led by Nat Friedman, former GitHub CEO), and (4) MSL Infrastructure. The consolidation is led by Alexandr Wang (28, founder/former CEO of Scale AI), whom Meta appointed as Chief AI Officer after acquiring a 49% stake in Scale AI for $14.3 billion.\n\nIn October 2025, Meta cut approximately 600 positions from MSL but notably spared the TBD Lab unit. Wang's internal memo explained: 'By reducing the size of our team, fewer conversations will be required to make a decision, and each person will be more load-bearing and have more scope and impact.'\n\nThe restructuring triggered the departure of Yann LeCun (Turing Award winner, Meta's Chief AI Scientist for 12 years), who publicly stated: 'You don't tell a researcher what to do. You certainly don't tell a researcher like me what to do.' LeCun left to found AMI Labs, pursuing alternative AI approaches (world models via V-JEPA). The departure represents a fundamental tension: Meta shifted from protecting long-term research autonomy (FAIR under LeCun) to subordinating research to product-driven commercial objectives (MSL under Wang).\n\nMeta is aggressively recruiting AI talent: 11 new researchers from DeepMind, OpenAI, and Anthropic, with Zuckerberg personally recruiting at his homes. New model roadmap includes Mango (image/video) and Avocado (text/reasoning) for H1 2026. Separately, Stratechery reported Meta is retreating from Reality Labs to fund AI infrastructure ('Meta Compute').",
