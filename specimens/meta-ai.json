  "description": "Meta reorganized its AI division into Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL) with 4 units: (1) TBD Lab (frontier models including Llama, led by Shengjia Zhao), (2) FAIR (long-term research), (3) Products & Applied Research (led by Nat Friedman, former GitHub CEO), and (4) MSL Infrastructure (led by Aparna Ramani). The consolidation is led by Alexandr Wang (28, founder/former CEO of Scale AI), whom Meta appointed as Chief AI Officer after acquiring a 49% stake in Scale AI for $14.3 billion.\n\nIn October 2025, Meta cut approximately 600 positions from MSL but notably spared the TBD Lab unit. Wang's internal memo described the restructuring as 'disruptive,' aimed at eliminating bureaucracy. The restructuring triggered the departure of Yann LeCun (Turing Award winner, Meta's Chief AI Scientist for 12 years), who publicly stated his disagreement with the new reporting structure and left to found AMI Labs.\n\nIn January 2026, Meta cut another 1,500 positions from Reality Labs (~10% of its ~15,000 workforce), closing three VR game studios (Armature, Sanzaru, Twisted Pixel) while protecting AR/wearables teams (Ray-Ban smart glasses). CFO Susan Li guided that Reality Labs losses would peak in 2026 then gradually decline. Cumulative Reality Labs losses since 2020 exceed $70 billion.\n\nMeta's Q4 2025 earnings revealed $59.89B revenue (beating estimates) and extraordinary 2026 CapEx guidance of $115-135B \u2014 nearly double 2025's $72.2B \u2014 the single largest AI investment commitment by any company. Zuckerberg described MSL as 'the most talent-dense research effort in the industry' six months after formation, and articulated a vision for 'personal superintelligence' \u2014 AI that understands personal context, history, interests, and relationships. He stated that 'what many big teams at Meta do can now be accomplished by a single, very talented person,' signaling explicit commitment to flattening teams and AI-native tooling that elevates individual contributors.",

    "RECLASSIFICATION: Model 1 \u2192 Model 4. Meta's evolution demonstrates how a Research Lab model can be subordinated to a Hub-and-Spoke model when product urgency overrides research autonomy. LeCun's departure is a clear signal of this transition.",
    "Meta is a powerful counter-example for Mechanism #1 (Protect Off-Strategy Work): when the CEO stops protecting research autonomy, the chief scientist leaves and the research lab loses its independence.",
    "The 'repeated reorgs' pattern (Puck: 'Why Did Meta Reorganize Its AI Unit... Again?') suggests organizational instability as a cost of rapid strategic pivots. The taxonomy doesn't capture the costs of excessive structural flexibility.",
    "Zuckerberg's 'single talented person' statement is the most explicit CEO endorsement of AI-driven management delayering we've documented. Combined with similar statements from Jassy (Amazon) and Nadella (Microsoft), this represents a cross-industry convergence on org flattening.",
    "The Reality Labs retreat pattern \u2014 $70B cumulative exploration losses followed by pivot to AI wearables \u2014 is a case study in how structural ambidexterity fails when the exploration bet doesn't deliver within the organization's tolerance window.",
    "[2026-02-12] meta-reality-labs specimen merged into this specimen. Reality Labs is a division of Meta, not an independent organizational unit. All RL data (sources, layers, taxonomy observations) is already captured here. The RL specimen was a Stub with a single source; this specimen covers RL comprehensively across multiple layers and sources.",
