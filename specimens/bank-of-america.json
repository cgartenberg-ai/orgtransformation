  "description": "Rather than building a separate innovation lab, Bank of America treated enterprise AI deployment as a consumer product problem. The key insight was to extend Erica — their customer-facing virtual assistant launched in 2018 — internally as 'Erica for Employees' in 2020, leveraging existing brand recognition, user familiarity, and proven conversational patterns.\n\nThe pandemic timing was crucial: rapid adoption occurred when employees needed technology support for remote work. Starting with IT support, the system expanded to health benefits, payroll, and tax forms — each expansion building on proven interaction patterns. The approach drove adoption that most enterprise tools never achieve: over 90% of 213,000 employees actively use AI tools daily.\n\nThe result over 15 years has been structural transformation without a formal transformation program: headcount reduced from 300,000 to 212,000 while deposits doubled, producing $6 billion in expense savings. Developer efficiency increased 20% through coding assistants. IT service desk calls were reduced by more than 50%.",

    "BofA blurs the line between 6a (Enterprise-Wide Adoption) and a de facto Center of Excellence (Model 2). There may be an internal technology team functioning as a CoE without the label. Worth investigating whether 6a specimens typically have hidden CoE structures.",
    "[2026-02] New earnings data strongly reinforces 6a classification. The $4.5B AI budget is substantial but channeled through existing technology organization, not a named AI unit. CEO's explicit 'AI agent' framing for Erica signals evolution toward agentic capabilities while maintaining contextual deployment pattern. The redeployment narrative (eliminating roles while adding client-facing associates) is a mature 6a outcome — AI enabling structural transformation without formal transformation program."
