  "description": "This specimen captures McKinsey's enterprise-wide workforce transformation under AI, as articulated by CEO Bob Sternfels. Rather than describing a distinct AI organizational structure (see mckinsey-quantumblack for that), this documents how AI adoption reshapes the entire consulting workforce.\n\nSternfels described AI as having 'fundamentally changed how McKinsey staffs its business, allowing it to add and cut jobs in equal measure' — approximately 25% growth in some roles and 25% cuts in others simultaneously. This is not a one-time restructuring but continuous workforce rebalancing.\n\nThe skills half-life insight is structural: ROI on employee skills has shrunk from ~7 years to 3.6 years over 30 years, and is accelerating. This implies the traditional training/upskilling approach needs fundamental rethinking. The CEO priority has shifted from strategy to organizational speed.",
