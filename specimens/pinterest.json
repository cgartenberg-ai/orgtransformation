  "description": "Pinterest is cutting 700-800 jobs (10-15% of ~5,200 workforce) in January 2026, explicitly framed as an AI pivot: 'reallocating resources to AI-focused roles and teams that drive AI adoption and execution.' The company is hiring 'AI-proficient talent' to replace cut roles.\n\nCEO Bill Ready describes the platform as 'an AI-powered shopping assistant for 600 million customers,' with the Pinterest Assistant shopping tool launched October 2025. Pre-tax restructuring charges of $35-45M through September 2026.\n\nNotably, the company acknowledged risks: restructuring may affect talent retention, distract management, and may not deliver intended benefits. Stock fell on announcement.",
