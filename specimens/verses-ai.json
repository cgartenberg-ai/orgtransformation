  "description": "VERSES AI experienced a classic founder-to-operator transition in February 2026. Founder/CEO Gabriel Rene, co-founder/Brand Ambassador Dan Mapes, and Chief Accounting Officer Kevin Wilson all resigned from positions and the board on February 10, 2026. David T. Scott was appointed Interim CEO, bringing a 30-year career spanning AWS, Twitter, and AT&T. Scott immediately articulated an explicit pivot from R&D exploration to commercial execution, targeting financial services as the initial market for VERSES' Genius agentic enterprise intelligence platform. The pattern is clean: exploration-stage founders depart, execution-stage operator arrives, and the organizational mission narrows from broad R&D to specific commercial targets.",

    "Clean example of the founder-to-operator pattern that often accompanies the exploration-to-execution transition. The new CEO's first statement is almost a textbook articulation of temporal ambidexterity: 'converting R&D into commercial products.'",
    "Small company but the pattern is analytically valuable as a reference case for how AI startups manage the research-to-product transition."
