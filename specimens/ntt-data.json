All three are centralized enablement functions — classic Model 2. Structural orientation: each CoE serves a distinct domain with separate leadership. Medium confidence: multiple sources confirm the multi-CoE structure, but internal coordination mechanisms between CoEs are unclear.",

  "description": "NTT DATA has built a distinctive triple-CoE structure for AI, with each center serving a different organizational function. The OpenAI Center of Excellence, established through a strategic collaboration with OpenAI, develops client-facing GenAI services powered by OpenAI APIs, tailored by industry vertical. Separately, an internal AI CoE within the CIO office (led by Maureen Tan) manages enterprise-wide AI integration using Azure AI Agent Service and Fabric data agents. A third Virtual CoE for CX, launched in 2026 starting in Czech Republic, Belgium, and Germany, focuses on AI-driven contact center solutions using Dynamics 365.\n\nNTT DATA's Smart AI Agent ecosystem, announced May 2025, targets $2B in revenue by 2027. The system includes a patented solution that converts legacy bots into autonomous intelligent agents — addressing the explore/execute tension by preserving existing automation investments while enabling agentic AI capabilities. Hundreds of agent instances are deployed across healthcare (insurance appeals, medical necessity decisions) and automotive (regulatory compliance) verticals.\n\nThe company was named ISG Provider Lens Leader for Agentic AI Services 2025 and partnered with Google Cloud (August 2025) for AI-powered cloud innovations, suggesting a platform-agnostic approach to AI enablement.",
