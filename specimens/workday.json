  "description": "Workday announced 1,750 layoffs (8.5% of workforce) in February 2025, with CEO Carl Eschenbach explicitly citing AI as the driver: 'Companies everywhere are reimagining how work gets done, and the increasing demand for AI has the potential to drive a new era of growth for Workday.'\n\nThe company simultaneously announced continued hiring in 'key strategic areas' including AI, suggesting a workforce composition shift rather than pure headcount reduction. Restructuring charges of $230-270M for severance and benefits.\n\nThis specimen is primarily valuable as an 'AI-washing' data point. Only 4-5% of tech layoffs explicitly cite AI as driver, and critics note companies may be using AI narrative to justify cost reductions. Former Amazon employee quoted: 'You could potentially have just been bloated in the first place, reduce head count, attribute it to AI, and now you've got a value story.' The specimen parallels Pinterest (also explicit AI-pivot layoffs) but with even less structural evidence of actual AI organizational change.",
