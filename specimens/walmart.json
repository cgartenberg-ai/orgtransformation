Furner's restructuring quote explicitly describes this: 'centralizing platforms to accelerate shared capabilities, freeing up our operating segments to be more focused on customers.' Secondary M5 reflects continued Platform-to-Product commercialization (Route Optimization, Walmart Commerce Technologies) though this is now subordinate to the hub-and-spoke operating model.",

  "description": "Walmart has built a sophisticated hub-and-spoke AI operating model with dedicated executive leadership and proprietary platforms. The central hub includes EVP of AI Acceleration Daniel Danker (reporting to Global CTO Suresh Kumar), CTO Hari Vasudev driving agentic AI strategy, and EVP Sravana Karnati overseeing the Element MLOps platform. This centralized capability team builds shared AI infrastructure\u2014Element for the full ML lifecycle, Wallaby as their retail-specific LLM, and a 'super agents' architecture where higher-level agents manage specialized task-specific agents.\n\nThe January 2026 restructuring formalized this model by creating a global Chief Growth Officer role to coordinate platforms while operational segments (US, International, Sam's Club) focus on customer-facing deployment. Walmart's 'surgical agentic AI' philosophy\u2014deploying agents for 'highly specific tasks' whose outputs 'stitch together'\u2014reflects architectural maturity beyond experimentation. With $500M+ invested in AI/robotics, 40%+ of new code AI-generated/assisted, and targets of 65% store automation, this represents enterprise-scale AI transformation.\n\nThe Intelligent Retail Lab (IRL) under Store No. 8 continues as an incubator for experimental AI applications, while commercialization efforts (Route Optimization as SaaS) persist as a secondary M5 pattern. The dominant structure, however, is hub-and-spoke: build centrally, deploy distributed, with clear separation between platform teams and operating segments.",
