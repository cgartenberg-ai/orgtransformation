  "description": "Walmart's strategic evolution encapsulates the 'Platform-to-Product' model: identifying internal operational capabilities and commercializing them as external revenue streams. The clearest example is Route Optimization, which began as internal logistics AI to reduce emissions and improve trailer packing.\n\nInternal results were dramatic: 94 million pounds of CO2 avoided, 30 million unnecessary miles eliminated, 110,000 inefficient paths optimized. The system won the 2023 Franz Edelman Award for operational excellence. Recognizing that value extended beyond internal cost savings, Walmart commercialized Route Optimization as SaaS through Walmart Commerce Technologies.\n\nGoLocal (2021) follows the same pattern: a white-label parcel delivery service that extends Walmart's last-mile infrastructure to other retailers. The corporate identity has shifted accordingly — Walmart now describes itself as 'an advertising business, a data company, a financial services provider, and a Software as a Service (SaaS) provider.'",
