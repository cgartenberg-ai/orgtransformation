  "description": "Palo Alto Networks represents an embedded AI adoption model where 2,500 developers across the cybersecurity company use Claude Code (Anthropic) as their primary AI development assistant. Rather than creating a separate AI lab, the company integrates AI tools directly into existing development workflows.\n\nAI assists with code generation, review, documentation, and debugging across the engineering organization. Junior developers use AI for accelerated onboarding, learning codebases 70% faster, while senior developers leverage AI for increased feature velocity (20-30% improvement). The capability is fully embedded — no separate AI team exists.\n\nThis model demonstrates how cybersecurity companies can adopt AI for internal productivity while their core product IS security. The embedded approach avoids creating a separate exploration function, instead making AI a standard tool in every developer's workflow.",
