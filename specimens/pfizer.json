  "description": "Pfizer has built a multi-layered AI organization under CAIO Berta Rodriguez-Hervas, combining internal capability building with strategic partnerships. The structure includes the AI/ML Fab Lab for experimentation and capability building, and the Predictive Analytics Incubator for applied AI in drug discovery.\n\nThe PACT (Pfizer-Amazon-Claude Trifecta) partnership with AWS and Anthropic represents a new model of pharmaceutical AI deployment, providing enterprise AI infrastructure. This external partnership supplements internal AI capabilities, creating a layered approach to AI capacity.\n\nResults include development cycles reduced from 6+ weeks to 6 weeks through AI acceleration, and drug candidate development compressed from 1+ year to 30 days using AI. The CAIO position provides executive-level AI leadership, ensuring strategic alignment between AI capabilities and drug development priorities.",
