  "description": "Pfizer has built a multi-layered AI organization under CAIO Berta Rodriguez-Hervas, combining internal capability building with strategic partnerships. The structure includes the AI/ML Fab Lab for experimentation and capability building, and the Predictive Analytics Incubator for applied AI in drug discovery.\n\nThe PACT (Pfizer-Amazon-Claude Trifecta) partnership with AWS and Anthropic represents a new model of pharmaceutical AI deployment, providing enterprise AI infrastructure. This external partnership supplements internal AI capabilities, creating a layered approach to AI capacity.\n\nQ4 2025 earnings revealed significant structural details: CSO Chris Boshoff described embedding AI engineers in each R&D function (discovery, medical, regulatory, safety, pharmacovigilance, clinical trial execution), confirming a hub-and-spoke talent deployment model. The company is investing in 1,200 GPUs over two years for R&D AI applications. CEO Bourla positioned AI as the 'main lever' for cost reduction while maintaining activity levels—achieving $600M in manufacturing savings in 2025 with $1.5B targeted by 2027.\n\nResults include development cycles reduced from 6+ weeks to 6 weeks through AI acceleration, and drug candidate development compressed from 1+ year to 30 days using AI.",
