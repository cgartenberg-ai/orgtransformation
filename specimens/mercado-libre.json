  "description": "Mercado Libre represents an unusual structural pattern: the founder himself becomes the central AI coordination point. Marcos Galperin transitioned from CEO to Executive Chairman on January 1, 2026, specifically to focus on artificial intelligence integration across the business, elevating AI from a departmental function to the central organizing principle.\n\nRather than delegating AI to a CAIO or technical function, the founder becomes the hub in a hub-and-spoke model, coordinating AI integration across Mercado Libre's e-commerce marketplace, Mercado Pago fintech, and logistics operations. The $13.2B investment in 2025 (including $3.4B in Mexico with explicit AI focus) signals the scale of commitment.\n\nGenAds, the company's generative AI advertising product, demonstrates the spoke execution pattern: a 45% increase in impressions and 90,000+ product creatives across 7 countries. With 18,000+ engineers and 28,000 planned hires (33% headcount increase), the company is scaling both AI capability and human capacity simultaneously.",
