  "description": "Sanofi operates a centralized 'AI Research Factory' model with dedicated AI scientists working on internal tools and models specific to drug discovery. The factory develops proprietary models like CodonBERT for understanding genetic code, and has identified 7 drug targets through AI approaches.\n\nThe plai platform serves as the internal AI deployment mechanism, enabling therapeutic area teams to leverage centralized AI capabilities without building their own. This hub-and-spoke arrangement allows the central factory to maintain cutting-edge AI research while therapeutic areas focus on domain-specific drug development.\n\nThe centralized model ensures consistency in AI governance and quality while the spoke deployment enables domain-specific application across Sanofi's therapeutic portfolio.",
