The 'Trailblazer' pattern from the AI Radar 2026 survey describes a cross-industry finding (60% budget to upskilling, CEO 8+ hours/week learning), not BCG's own structure. Contextual orientation: BCG's approach emphasizes AI fluency across all consultant roles rather than separating AI specialists. Medium confidence because the specimen data primarily describes BCG's research findings rather than BCG's own organizational structure.",

  "description": "BCG's AI Radar 2026 survey of 2,360 executives identified 'Trailblazers' representing ~15% of companies who drive AI transformation through decisive investment in workforce capability.\n- Defining characteristic: 60% of Trailblazing CEOs' AI budgets go to upskilling and retraining current workforce (vs. 27% Pragmatists, 24% Followers)\n- CEO personal investment: Trailblazing CEOs spend 8+ hours per week on their own AI upskilling—twice the counterpart average\n- Agentic AI deployment: Trailblazers direct 50%+ of 2026 AI investment to agents, 2x more likely to deploy end-to-end\n- Regional finding: Africa leads globally with 42% Trailblazer CEOs (vs. 14% EU), averaging 8.3 hours/week learning AI\n- Pressure driver: 50% of CEOs believe their job depends on getting AI right",
