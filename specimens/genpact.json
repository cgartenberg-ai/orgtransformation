The 7,000 AI builders and 20,000 practitioners suggest a secondary M2 CoE function for training and enablement.

  "description": "Genpact represents a fascinating case of a traditional BPO company undergoing fundamental business model transformation through AI. The company has created a distinct Advanced Technology Solutions unit that generated $1.2B in 2025 revenue (up 17% YoY), representing 24% of total revenue and over one-third of total bookings. This unit delivers more than 2x the revenue per headcount compared to traditional BPO services—a striking productivity differential that signals genuine structural separation.\n\nThe company has developed a 'three-pillar agentic operations model' consisting of: (1) domain-specific agents executing tasks autonomously, (2) last-mile experts validating exceptions and training models, and (3) clear governance roles. This architecture productizes what would otherwise be internal AI enablement into a client-facing offering. With over 7,000 AI builders trained, nearly 20,000 AI practitioners, and 400+ GenAI solutions deployed or going live (nearly tripled from prior year), Genpact has built substantial AI capability at scale.\n\nMost structurally significant is the revenue model shift: 48% of Q4 revenue came from non-FTE (non-headcount-based) revenue models. For a BPO company historically selling labor, this represents a fundamental transformation—moving from selling people to selling AI-powered solutions. The AI Maestro platform for embedding AI across operations codifies this productization.",

    "[2026-02] Genpact challenges the M5c 'Platform-to-Product' model in an interesting way: rather than a tech company externalizing a capability (like Walmart with GoLocal), this is a services company productizing AI to escape its own labor-based business model. The 48% non-FTE revenue metric is a structural signal worth tracking across BPO/services specimens.",
    "[2026-02] The 2x revenue-per-headcount differential between Advanced Technology Solutions and traditional BPO is an unusually clean marker of structural separation's economic value. This could become a diagnostic metric for M5 specimens generally.",
    "[2026-02] The 'three-pillar agentic operations model' (autonomous agents + human validators + governance) may represent an emerging architectural pattern for how enterprises operationalize agentic AI. Worth watching if similar structures appear in other specimens."
