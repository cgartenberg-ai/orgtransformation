  "description": "Apple is restructuring its AI organization from a centralized model under former SVP John Giannandrea to a hybrid hub-and-spoke model aligned with the company's traditional functional structure. The new VP of AI, Amar Subramanya (hired from Microsoft/Google), reports to Craig Federighi and provides central coordination for ML research, AI safety, and evaluation across device, edge, and cloud environments. This 'hub' sets standards while execution is distributed across functional 'spokes' — Foundation Models and Siri under Federighi, robotics under hardware, services AI under Eddy Cue, and operations AI under Sabih Khan.\n\nInvestment signals are massive: $500B+ committed to US operations including AI-focused R&D and server infrastructure, custom AI chips in development (including 'Baltra' server processor), a dedicated AI server farm in Houston, and 12,000 hires in the past year with 40% in R&D 'many focused on AI.' Tim Cook has positioned AI as a 'once-in-a-generation shift' and stated Apple will 'spend what it takes to compete' — even signaling openness to acquisitions, a notable departure from Apple's traditional build-over-buy approach.\n\nThe structural reorganization reflects both opportunity and catch-up pressure. Craig Federighi acknowledged that a hybrid approach to Siri 'wasn't going to get us to Apple quality,' leading to a ground-up rebuild under Mike Rockwell. Apple maintains research presence through the Zurich Vision Lab (which has hired 36+ former Google AI researchers since 2018) and a new 20,000 square meter Shenzhen facility. Partnerships with Google on Foundation Models and OpenAI for ChatGPT integration in Siri supplement in-house capabilities.",
