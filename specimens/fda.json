  "description": "The FDA hired Jeremy Walsh as its first Chief AI Officer AND Head of IT — a combined role that places AI governance directly within the IT function. Walsh comes from an IT professional background with federal health agency contracting experience. This contrasts with the emerging pattern of hiring CAIOs from consumer tech or data science backgrounds (Mechanism #9), suggesting federal agencies may follow a different pipeline where IT operations experience is valued over AI research or product expertise.",
