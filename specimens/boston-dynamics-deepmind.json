  "description": "A new partnership between Boston Dynamics and Google DeepMind to bring foundational AI to humanoid robots. Google DeepMind is advancing Gemini Robotics foundation models for robots 'of any shape and size.' The partnership represents a cross-company structural exploration model: DeepMind provides the model exploration (research frontier), while Boston Dynamics provides the execution/hardware platform.\n\nThis is a notable structural arrangement because the exploration and execution functions live in entirely different companies, connected by a formal partnership rather than internal reporting lines.",
