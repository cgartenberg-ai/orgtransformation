Decision tree walk: Accenture has formal AI practice → central team enables others (consultants) → Model 2 (CoE). However, the 40K license deployment is more like enterprise-wide adoption (6a). Kept as Model 2 given Accenture's primary function as enabler/advisor, but noted the tension. Confidence downgraded to Low due to thin structural data about Accenture's own AI organization. Fixed industry. Removed spurious quote.",
