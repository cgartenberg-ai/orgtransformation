Automation and AI-enabled systems will allow middle-office and operational functions to run with fewer employees.\n\nThis is part of a broader financial services AI restructuring wave: UBS (first CAIO), Wells Fargo (Head of AI), JPMorgan (AI CoE), Commonwealth Bank (first CAIO). Citigroup's approach appears to be enterprise-wide automation rather than dedicated AI organizational structure.",
