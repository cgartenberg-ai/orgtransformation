  "description": "Citigroup is executing 'Project Bora Bora' — a multi-year AI-driven restructuring targeting 20,000 role eliminations (~8% of workforce) and $2.5B annualized cost savings by 2026. CEO Jane Fraser frames this as cultural transformation, not just automation: eliminating 'the last vestiges of old, bad habits' and demanding a 'more commercial mindset.'\n\nScale of adoption is remarkable: 70% AI adoption rate across 84 countries, 21M+ interactions with proprietary AI tools, 175K employees completed mandatory AI training, 2.6M customer interactions automated monthly, 9% developer productivity increase. Over 10K of the 20K target reductions already achieved.\n\nThis is enterprise-wide contextual adoption — no CAIO, no dedicated AI lab, AI integrated into existing functions rather than separated structurally.",

    "Financial services AI restructuring is a sector-level pattern: Citigroup (-20K), Amazon (-16K+), Coca-Cola (phased), all citing AI. The taxonomy could benefit from a 'sector wave' concept.",
    "Citigroup's approach (automate middle office) is different from UBS (appoint CAIO) or JPMorgan (build CoE). Same sector, different organizational responses to AI.",
    "[2026-02] Citigroup is emerging as a potential type specimen for Model 6a at scale. 70% adoption across 84 countries without a CAIO or dedicated AI lab suggests enterprise-wide contextual adoption can achieve massive scale through mandatory training (175K employees) and cultural framing ('judged on results'). Fraser's language about eliminating 'old, bad habits' is interesting — positioning AI adoption as cultural transformation rather than technical change.",
    "[2026-02] The lack of structural AI leadership despite this scale is notable. Compare to JPMorgan (AI CoE), UBS (CAIO). Citigroup achieves similar adoption through Project Bora Bora restructuring + mandatory training. This may be an alternative path to enterprise AI adoption: restructuring-driven rather than structure-driven."
