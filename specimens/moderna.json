  "description": "Moderna exemplifies the enterprise-wide adoption model where the 'lab' is the entire organization. The company set a goal of achieving 100% AI proficiency across all employees with access to digital solutions within six months, supported by a structured three-layer change management approach.\n\nThe three layers operate as: Individual (in-depth research, listening programs, trainings), Collective (AI prompt contest identified top 100 power users who became 'Generative AI Champions'), and Structural (AI Academy evolved from educational content to an innovation incubator for AI capability, projects, and ideas). mChat, Moderna's internal chatbot on OpenAI's API, achieved 80%+ employee adoption. Since deploying ChatGPT Enterprise, the company has generated 750+ custom GPTs.\n\nAfter reporting a $1B quarterly loss in 2025, Moderna restructured to treat AI as a collaborator rather than a tool, creating a new role of Chief People and Digital Technology Officer overseeing merged HR and tech departments. This enables 'work planning' instead of 'workforce planning' — managing work outputs rather than headcount. The informational nature of mRNA technology provides natural AI-biology fit.",
