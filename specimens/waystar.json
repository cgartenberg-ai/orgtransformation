  "description": "Waystar announced agentic intelligence at JPM 2026, articulating a vision for the 'autonomous revenue cycle' where AI agents handle healthcare billing, denials, and claims without human intervention. The company processed 7.5+ billion insurance transactions in 2025, positioning proprietary data as its key differentiator.\n\nIn July 2025, Waystar acquired Iodine Software (which processes one in three clinical hospital discharges), adding 'troves of new data to train and refine AI models.' The platform now includes 150+ AI-trained models building toward a 'dynamic, end-to-end agentic network that continuously acts within workflows, executes defined tasks, and learns from outcomes with minimal intervention.'\n\nIn practice, agentic AI analyzes full medical records in seconds, prioritizes 30,000 most relevant data points, and auto-populates correction requests with clinical context. Results include $15.5B in prevented denials, ~40% reduction in manual correction workload, and 95% time savings in denial-related workflows.",
