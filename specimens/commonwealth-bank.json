  "description": "Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) deployed ChatGPT Enterprise to all 50,000 employees, representing the largest single ChatGPT Enterprise deployment in the world. CEO Matt Comyn personally engaged with the rollout, spending significant time understanding AI capabilities and use cases. The approach rejected pilot-based rollout in favor of universal access.\n\nIn late 2025, CBA appointed Ranil Boteju as its first Chief AI Officer, commencing early 2026. Boteju was hired from Lloyds Banking Group where he was Group Chief Data and Analytics Officer, leading 2,000+ people and delivering 50+ GenAI initiatives. CBA already ranks 4th globally in the Evident AI Index, indicating strong existing capability. The CAIO formalizes leadership over what had been a more informal, enterprise-wide adoption pattern.\n\nCEO Matt Comyn frames the approach as 'building tomorrow's bank today' — an explicit explore/execute tension. The evolution from contextual/informal AI adoption to formal structural leadership (CAIO appointment) represents a notable maturation pattern.",
