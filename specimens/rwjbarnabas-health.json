  "description": "RWJBarnabas Health and Rutgers Health established a joint AI Center of Excellence spanning 14 hospitals (12 acute care, 1 behavioral health, Children's Specialized Hospital). The CoE is governed by a Joint AI Executive Committee with leaders from both organizations, ensuring alignment with clinical priorities, ethical standards, and strategic goals.\n\nGoal areas include improving patient outcomes, reducing clinician burden and burnout, enhancing professional fulfillment, streamlining operations, and delivering long-term ROI. The joint governance structure across a health system and academic partner is structurally interesting — it creates a bridge between clinical operations and academic research.\n\nThis is the first healthcare system specimen in the collection, representing the Model 2 (CoE) pattern in a heavily regulated, multi-site healthcare context where patient safety requirements and regulatory constraints shape AI deployment differently than in technology or financial services.",

    "The joint health system + academic partner governance model is a distinct structural pattern worth tracking. Academic partners bring research capability; health systems bring clinical data and deployment context.",
    "Healthcare industry AI adoption is likely underrepresented in our collection. Search for: Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, Intermountain Health, Kaiser Permanente AI org structures."
