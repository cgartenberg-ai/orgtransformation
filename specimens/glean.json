  "taxonomyFeedback": [
    "[2026-02] Classification as M9 AI-Native may be misleading — this specimen's value lies not in its org structure (which is undocumented) but as a *negative result* that challenges the assumption that AI-native companies have solved internal automation. Glean builds AI search for enterprise customers yet failed to automate their own internal workflow prioritization, revealing a boundary condition: being AI-native doesn't immunize you from the exploration/execution tension when turning AI inward. The 'shoemaker's children have no shoes' pattern suggests M9 may need a subtype for AI-native firms that struggle with internal AI adoption despite external AI competence.",
    "[2026-02] The failed fine-tuning attempt is structurally significant because it signals a technical dead-end that may have org structure implications across the collection. If a $7.2B AI company with deep technical talent couldn't make custom model fine-tuning work economically, this weakens the case for M1 Research Labs or M5 Product Labs investing in foundational model development. The Glean evidence suggests the economics increasingly favor M3 Embedded Teams building on commodity foundation models rather than M1/M2 investing in custom model infrastructure — a potential phase shift in the structural landscape that would affect classification logic for other specimens.",
    "[2026-02] The 'automation harder than expected' admission creates an interesting contrast with specimens like Duolingo (which deployed Birdbrain broadly despite uncertainty) and Chegg (which over-indexed on AI automation promises and suffered market consequences). Glean sits between these: they tried internal automation, it failed, but this didn't derail the company because their *external* product remained viable. This suggests a contingency factor we're not tracking: **internal vs. external AI deployment risk tolerance**. AI-native firms may have *lower* tolerance for internal AI automation risk because failure would undermine their external credibility, whereas non-AI firms (Duolingo) can experiment more freely because internal AI work doesn't threaten their market positioning."
