  "description": "World Labs was founded by Fei-Fei Li (Stanford professor, ImageNet creator) and Justin Johnson as an AI research lab spin-off from academia. The company launched 'Marble,' a generative world model for editable 3D environments, representing the move from pure research toward product. World Labs occupies a similar space to AMI Labs (Yann LeCun) — both are academic-origin research labs pursuing alternatives to the dominant LLM paradigm, focused on spatial understanding and world models.",
