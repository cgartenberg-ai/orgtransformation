  "description": "SAP CEO Christian Klein articulated a distinctive AI philosophy that challenges standalone AI tools: AI must be deeply embedded in business processes, not treated as standalone technology. The three-pillar architecture — modern cloud software + modern data management + consistent AI stack — demands tight coupling between AI capability and business application.\n\nJoule, SAP's AI copilot, is built centrally and deployed across the product portfolio, delivering claimed 30-40% productivity increases. The EU AI Cloud launched with sovereign data guarantees addresses regulatory requirements while enabling AI deployment. Real customer results include Johnson Controls (3,000 hours/year saved), Bosch (2,500 hours per service center per year), and JK Cement (50% faster purchasing).\n\nThe vision is transformative: within 2 years, SAP users will no longer manually enter data, with all tasks processed via natural language. This represents a fundamental shift from data entry to AI-mediated business process management.\n\nQ4 FY2025 results show accelerating AI adoption: SAP Business AI was included in two-thirds of Q4 cloud order entry (up 20+ percentage points from Q3), and 90% of the 50 largest Q4 deals included AI or SAP Business Data Cloud. Total Cloud Backlog grew 30% to a record €77 billion.",
