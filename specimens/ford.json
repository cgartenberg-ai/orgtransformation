  "description": "Ford operates one of the most distributed AI structures in the automotive industry, with multiple specialized units pursuing different AI applications at varying time horizons. The flagship AI unit is Latitude AI, a 550-person wholly owned subsidiary headquartered in Pittsburgh focused on hands-free, eyes-off automated driving technology. Unlike most corporate AI labs, Latitude operates with its own CEO (Sammy Omari), CTO (Peter Carr), and President (David Gollob)—a level of structural independence typically reserved for true spin-offs.\n\nThe company's broader AI structure includes Greenfield Labs in Palo Alto (~300 researchers focused on human-centered design), FARIC in Atlanta (software and digital transformation), and a skunkworks unit under Doug Field (ex-Apple, Tesla) developing affordable EVs. This distributed model reflects Ford's 2022 Ford+ restructuring, which separated the company into Model e (EVs), Ford Blue (ICE vehicles), and Ford Pro (commercial)—a structural ambidexterity approach that physically separates exploration from execution.\n\nCEO Jim Farley frames AI primarily through a workforce impact lens, warning that AI will 'replace literally half of all white-collar workers' while advocating for AI to 'supercharge' essential economy workers rather than replace them. This philosophical stance positions Ford's AI strategy as much about workforce transformation as product innovation, with a focus on deploying AI 'systemically across the entire industrial system' rather than just in vehicles.",

    "[2026-02] Ford's Latitude AI represents an unusually autonomous M4 spoke—operating as a wholly owned subsidiary with its own CEO, CTO, and President is rare for corporate AI units. This creates a structural independence that borders on M5b (Venture Builder) but without the intent to spin off. The taxonomy may need to distinguish between 'subsidiary autonomy' and 'division autonomy' within M4.",
    "[2026-02] CEO Farley's public framing of AI is almost entirely about workforce transformation rather than product/technology. His 'essential economy' thesis—that AI will devastate white-collar work while skilled trades become more valuable—is a distinctive strategic narrative that shapes how Ford positions its AI investments. This workforce-centric framing is rare among automotive CEOs.",
    "[2026-02] The Ford+ restructuring (Model e/Blue/Pro separation) combined with multiple innovation centers (Latitude AI, Greenfield Labs, FARIC, skunkworks) creates a nested structural ambidexterity: exploration vs. execution separated at both the division level AND within the innovation portfolio. This 'ambidexterity within ambidexterity' pattern may warrant taxonomic attention."
