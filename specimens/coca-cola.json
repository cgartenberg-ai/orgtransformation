The Digital Council (CFO-chaired, cross-functional) coordinates AI strategy without creating a separate structural unit. The expectation is that ALL employees embed AI into their workflows rather than specialists doing AI work. This is textbook Contextual orientation: individuals balance exploration and execution within their existing roles. The '6b Centralized-but-Unnamed' subtype fits because there IS a central coordinating body (Digital Council + Head of Generative AI), but it operates as a governance overlay rather than a distinct organizational unit with its own staff.",

  "description": "Coca-Cola structures AI work through a Digital Council created in January 2023, chaired by CFO John Murphy with the CMO and CIO as key members. Rather than building a large dedicated AI organization, the company pursues a 'contextual' strategy where AI adoption is embedded across all functions. Only 2 of approximately 2,000 marketing employees have 'AI' in their job titles — the expectation is that everyone embraces AI in their workflows.\n\nThe company has a single Global VP and Head of Generative AI (Pratik Thakar) who leads external partnerships like the MIT Generative AI Impact Consortium and coordinates strategy, but without building a large internal team. The CIO Neeraj Tolmare operates under a CEO mandate requiring AI pilots to demonstrate 'real outcomes that move the needle' before production deployment. Multiple pilots are underway with measurable results: 7-8% sales increase from demand prediction algorithms, 20% higher consumer engagement from AI-generated content, and 10x faster design production via Project Fizzion with Adobe.\n\nA significant structural evolution is underway: effective March 2026, a new Chief Digital Officer (Sedef Salingan Sahin) will take over digital strategy from CFO Murphy and bring together digital, data, and operational excellence. This could signal maturation from the current coordination-focused model toward a more consolidated digital/AI authority.",

    "CDO vs. CAIO distinction matters: a CDO covers broader digital transformation while a CAIO focuses specifically on AI. Coca-Cola's choice of CDO suggests AI is embedded within a broader digital mandate rather than separated.",
    "CPG industry pattern: Coca-Cola, Nestlé, Kraft Heinz, Unilever, Mars all restructuring simultaneously around AI. Industry-level wave worth tracking.",
    "[2026-02-12 M4 Audit] M4 classification under review (Audit 2026-02-12). Almost no structural data beyond CDO appointment and Microsoft partnership. Current M4 classification is poorly supported at Low completeness/Low confidence. Needs enrichment or reclassification to Unclassified/Stub.",
    "[2026-02] Coca-Cola exemplifies the 'contextual orientation + informal structure' combination that may be more common than our taxonomy suggests. The '2 of 2,000' stat is a powerful empirical marker — most specimens don't provide such clear evidence of deliberate NON-specialization. This suggests we may need better markers for distinguishing contextual intent from mere structural immaturity.",
    "[2026-02] The CFO-as-AI-champion pattern (Murphy chairing Digital Council) challenges assumptions about who leads AI transformation. Coca-Cola places AI governance in finance/strategy rather than technology or operations — suggesting AI is treated as a business transformation lever rather than a technical capability. This is distinct from CIO-led or CTO-led models.",
    "[2026-02] The incoming CDO role (March 2026) creates a natural experiment: will consolidating 'digital, data, and operational excellence' under one executive shift Coca-Cola from contextual/informal toward structural/formal? Worth tracking as potential evidence of organizational evolution pathways."
