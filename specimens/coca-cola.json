However, internal AI organizational structure is largely inferred — the data describes executive appointments and partnerships, not team structures. Low confidence reflects this inference gap.",

  "description": "Coca-Cola is undergoing simultaneous CEO transition and AI-driven restructuring in early 2026. Incoming CEO Henrique Braun (succeeding James Quincey effective March 31, 2026) created a new Chief Digital Officer role, appointing 22-year veteran Sedef Sahin — calling it 'a pivotal new role for our future.'\n\nThe restructuring began with 75 layoffs in Atlanta (January 2026) as the first phase, with more waves planned starting February 28, 2026. Simultaneously, the company is reorganizing into two new market groupings emphasizing Asia, Africa, and Middle East.\n\nThis builds on a $1.1B strategic partnership with Microsoft (announced 2024) deploying Azure OpenAI Service and Copilot across operations. The combination of executive transition, digital leadership appointment, and AI partnership creates a multi-pronged organizational transformation.",
