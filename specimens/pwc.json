  "description": "PwC appointed Dan Priest as Chief AI Officer, previously cloud and digital leader at PwC with 11 years at the firm and prior experience as VP and CIO at Toyota Financial Services. This career path — enterprise IT (Toyota CIO) to consulting digital leader to consulting CAIO — represents a distinct variant of the CAIO pipeline.\n\nPwC committed $1B to AI investment over three years, covering both customer-facing AI offerings and internal operations. The firm's 2026 CAIO framework articulates an evolution of the AI leadership role: from a single executive to a 'portfolio of accountable owners across value creation, governance, and production operations' — suggesting the CAIO function is being distributed across the organization while maintaining centralized coordination.\n\nPwC advocates a dual AI strategy: 'defense' (safeguarding market position against AI-powered rivals) and 'offense' (entering or creating new markets). Key data points from PwC's research: 79% of executives say their companies are already adopting AI agents, and 58% say Responsible AI boosts ROI and efficiency.",
