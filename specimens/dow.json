  "description": "Dow Inc., a 129-year-old chemical manufacturer, is cutting approximately 4,500 jobs (~13% of 34,600 workforce) in a restructuring initiative named 'Transform to Outperform.' CEO Jim Fitterling describes it as 'radical simplification' — shedding layers of bureaucracy and integrating AI and automation to handle tasks previously requiring manual oversight.\n\nThe company uses C3 AI as its AI software platform. Expected one-time charges of $1.1-1.5B through 2027, with projected $2B+ in additional operating EBITDA. This follows prior layoff waves: 2,000 in early 2023 and 1,500 in January 2025.\n\nDow represents the AI restructuring wave hitting traditional industrial companies — transforming from chemical manufacturer to 'tech-enabled materials science leader.'",
