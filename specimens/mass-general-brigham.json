YES (academic medical center), but primary output is clinical tools and infrastructure. Central team? YES (CDIO's 1,800+ person organization). Builds or enables? Both — builds clinical AI tools and enables research-to-product translation. Central + distributed = M4. Secondary M5 for AIwithCare spinout (commercialization of clinical trial screening AI — rare for an academic medical center). Structural orientation: AI organized as a separate division under CDIO, distinct from clinical operations. Guardrails: G4 (prestige bias) — 1,800+ staff is genuinely a large dedicated organization, not just a prestigious label; G7 (M5 vs M8) — AIwithCare is adjacent commercialization, not core replacement, confirmed M5.",

  "description": "Mass General Brigham operates one of the largest named digital and AI organizations in healthcare, with 1,800+ staff under Chief Information and Digital Officer Jane Moran. This scale rivals dedicated AI divisions at major technology companies and dwarfs the AI teams at most health systems, reflecting MGB's position as a leading academic medical center with deep research capabilities.\n\nWhat distinguishes MGB structurally is the research-to-product bridge model. The AI team combines clinicians, data scientists, product managers, technical program managers, and software engineers — a deliberately cross-functional composition designed to translate research discoveries into deployable clinical tools. This translation pipeline produced AIwithCare, a rare spinout company from an academic medical center that commercializes clinical trial screening AI. The spinout represents a structural decision: rather than keeping the commercialization capability internal (M5a) or licensing it (M5c), MGB created an independent entity to bring clinical AI to market.\n\nThe dual identity — world-class academic research institution and increasingly product-oriented AI organization — creates a structural tension that most academic medical centers don't face at this scale. MGB must balance the academic incentives (publications, grants, tenure) with product incentives (clinical deployment, commercial viability, user adoption). The 1,800+ person digital organization is large enough to sustain both missions, but the governance challenge is directing resources between pure research and applied clinical AI.",

  "taxonomyFeedback": [
    "MGB's 1,800+ digital staff makes it one of the largest dedicated AI/digital organizations in healthcare — comparable in scale to some tech company AI divisions. This challenges the assumption that healthcare AI is primarily vendor-dependent.",
    "The AIwithCare spinout is structurally unusual for an academic medical center. Most academic institutions license IP or publish research; creating a commercial spinout is a Silicon Valley structural pattern transplanted to academic medicine. Worth tracking whether other academic medical centers follow."
