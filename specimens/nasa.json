  "description": "NASA's CAIO transition: David Salvagnini was named NASA's first Chief AI Officer in May 2024, among the first federal agencies to comply with White House Executive Order #14110. Salvagnini departed Nov 30, 2025 (deferred resignation, spring 2026 retirement). He came from intelligence community CIO and 21-year Air Force background. Kevin Murphy became acting CAIO and CDO — a 17+ year NASA insider from Earth Science Data Systems. The transition represents a shift from external defense/IC leadership to internal domain expertise.",
