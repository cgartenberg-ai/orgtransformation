## Reclassifications
None.

## Taxonomy Feedback
- **Ad industry CAIO wave**: Stagwell is the first ad holding company specimen. The holding company structure presents a distinctive coordination challenge — CAIO must integrate AI across semi-autonomous creative agencies. The Stagwell, Monks, IPG, Momentum wave mirrors the 2024-2025 wave in banking/finance.
- **CAIO pipeline variant**: Kahan's career path (enterprise tech → ad holding company) is a distinct CAIO pipeline worth tracking alongside academic → finance, consumer tech → enterprise, and data/analytics → banking pipelines documented in other specimens.
- **Boomerang hire pattern**: CBA's Boteju is a boomerang hire (CBA 2007-2010 → international banking → return as CAIO). This may be an emerging CAIO recruitment pattern — organizations reaching back to alumni who understand the culture and now bring external AI leadership experience.

## Type Specimens Identified
None.

## Edge Cases
- **Stagwell M2 vs M4**: Could be argued as M4 (hub-and-spoke) if individual agencies have their own AI initiatives that Kahan coordinates. Classified as M2 because no evidence of distributed AI units — the CAIO appears to be a centralized governance role rather than a coordinator of autonomous AI teams.
