# Curation Session: 2026-02-15

## Summary

Processed 10 research sessions containing 40+ organization references (with significant overlap across sessions). Created 8 new specimens. Updated 17 existing specimens. No reclassifications.

This was the largest single curation session, processing the output of Session 34's four parallel research agents (3 earnings batches + 1 press/podcast sweep) plus 6 previously-pending deep scan sessions from Feb 12. Sessions 2-6 (deep scans) had their data already incorporated through overnight curation runs on Feb 13-14, but their queue entries were never marked curated — this session closes that gap.

## Processing Notes

### Sessions 1-6 (Deep Scans + Podcast): Already Incorporated

Sessions 2-6 (caio-reorg-discovery, xai-deep-scan, intuit-deep-scan, klarna-backfire, salesforce-evolution) were discovered to have ALL data already present in specimens through overlapping overnight curation runs. These were marked curated without additional processing.

Session 1 (podcast-deep-scan) required one update: adding a new Dwarkesh podcast layer to xAI with 4 new Musk quotes on engineer-vs-researcher identity. SpaceX-xAI data folded into xAI specimen.

### Sessions 7-9 (Earnings Batches): 13 Specimens Batch-Updated

All 13 existing specimens updated with new earnings layers via Python batch script:
- Alphabet/Google DeepMind: $175-185B CapEx (nearly 2x 2025), 50% AI-generated code, Gemini 750M+ MAUs
- Salesforce: ~1K Feb 2026 layoffs (marketing, PM, data analytics, Agentforce teams)
- NVIDIA: $57B Q3 revenue, GTC 2026 March 16-19
- Walmart: CEO succession McMillon→Furner, 65% stores automated by 2026
- Disney: Three AI pillars, OpenAI/Sora 3-year licensing deal
- Intel: Tan centralized DCAI, 24K layoffs (15%), Eric Demers GPU hire from AMD/Qualcomm
- Eli Lilly: NVIDIA $1B co-innovation lab, TuneLab 1,300+ biotech customers
- Moderna: 4,000+ custom GPTs, $2.2B OpEx reduction (30%)
- Shopify: MCP Everything, unlimited AI spending, 1K intern "AI centaurs"
- Amazon: $200B CapEx, Trainium $10B+, 30K corporate layoffs (78% managers)
- Meta: Meta Compute new top-level org, MSL four-team structure
- Microsoft: Suleyman MAI self-sufficiency, Copilot 15M paid seats
- UPS: 78K positions eliminated, 127 automated buildings

### Session 10 (Press/Podcast Sweep): 4 New + 3 Updated

**New specimens created:**
- Baker McKenzie (M6a Contextual): 600-1,000 support staff cut, attorney firewall, Anthropic Claude Cowork as catalyst
- Arm Holdings (M4 Structural): Three-division reorg with Physical AI unit (Drew Henry)
- Forrester Research (M6b+M5 Contextual): AI-first research pivot, exiting consulting, Forrester AI product
- Capgemini (M6a Contextual): EUR 700M restructuring, "catalyst for enterprise-wide AI adoption"

**Existing specimens updated:**
- Workday: Added layer with CEO ouster detail, Bhusri "bigger than SaaS" quote, cumulative 10.5% cuts
- ASML: Added layer with 1,700 management cuts, matrix→product-dedicated engineering reorg
- Lionsgate: Added RMNStars source

**Skipped (already current):** xAI, Salesforce, Panasonic (all had data from prior processing)

**Signal-only (no specimen):** New York State CAIO appointment

### Thin Stubs Created (Session 2)

Four thin stubs created from caio-reorg-discovery session for orgs not already in the registry:
- fda-hhs (M2 CoE): Federal CAIO appointments (FDA + HHS)
- columbia-group (M2 CoE): Maritime AI factory concept
- liverpool-city-region (M2 CoE): UK's first regional CAIO
- verses-ai (M5a Temporal): Founder-to-operator transition

## Classification Reasoning

### New Specimens

| Organization | Decision Tree Path | Guardrails Applied | Key Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Baker McKenzie | Formal unit=NO → M6. Mass adoption (Claude Cowork enterprise-wide)? → M6a | G5: Not AI-native (founded 1949). G6: One-time restructuring, not temporal cycling. | Claude Cowork cited as catalyst, 600-1K cuts |
| Arm Holdings | Formal unit=YES (Physical AI division) → Central team=YES (3 divisions under corporate) → 3+ units=YES → M4 | G2: Three divisions = federation. G8: Bidirectional unclear with limited data. | Three-division reorg at CES 2026 |
| Forrester | Formal unit=NO (AI product exists, no named lab) → M6b. AI product being commercialized → M5 secondary | G4: Not M1 despite "research" company. G6: One-time pivot, not cycling. | Forrester AI product, consulting exit |
| Capgemini | Formal unit=NO → M6. Enterprise-wide "catalyst" framing → M6a | G5: Not AI-native. G6: One-time restructuring. | EUR 700M restructuring, >10% AI bookings |

### Updated Specimens — No Reclassifications

All 17 updated specimens maintained their existing classifications. New earnings/restructuring data enriched existing layers without contradicting structural models.

## Cross-Cutting Patterns

1. **Professional services restructuring wave (Feb 2026)**: Baker McKenzie (600-1K cuts), Capgemini (EUR 700M), Forrester (8% + consulting exit) all announced within days. Professional services firms face a unique tension: their product IS human expertise, so AI restructuring directly threatens the core business model. Three distinct responses: (a) protect fee-earners, cut support (Baker McKenzie), (b) massive skills re-investment (Capgemini), (c) cannibalize own product with AI replacement (Forrester).

2. **Hyperscaler CapEx explosion converges in one batch**: Alphabet $175-185B + Amazon $200B + Meta $115-135B + Microsoft $100-125B = $590-645B combined for 2026. This is the largest coordinated capital allocation in corporate history. Structural implication: AI infrastructure investment is now so large it creates organizational gravity — dedicated compute divisions (Meta Compute), procurement empires (Trainium teams), and supply chain organizations that didn't exist 2 years ago.

3. **Management delayering as cross-industry pattern**: Amazon 78% of 30K cuts were managers (L5-L7), UPS 12K managers of 78K total, ASML cutting management/leadership specifically while creating engineering jobs. This isn't AI-specific — it's a structural response where AI enables flatter organizations by reducing the information-processing role of middle managers.

4. **Agentic AI as direct restructuring catalyst**: Salesforce Agentforce driving support 9K→5K, Baker McKenzie citing Anthropic Claude Cowork specifically, Moderna 4,000+ custom GPTs replacing processes. The shift from "AI tools" to "AI agents" is the specific technology trigger for structural change.

5. **CEO succession as structural inflection**: Disney (Iger→D'Amaro), Intel (Gelsinger→Tan), Walmart (McMillon→Furner), Workday (Eschenbach→Bhusri founder return). Four CEO transitions in one earnings cycle, all with AI structural implications. The Workday founder-return pattern is particularly notable — echoes Howard Schultz at Starbucks, Jack Dorsey at Twitter.

6. **Matrix-to-product reorg pattern**: ASML (matrix→product-dedicated engineering), xAI (research lab→4 product divisions). Both are shedding coordination overhead. ASML CFO Dassen's "make sure engineers can be engineers again" is the cleanest articulation of the motivation.

## Taxonomy Feedback

- **Professional services as underexplored habitat**: Three new professional services specimens in one session (Baker McKenzie, Forrester, Capgemini) reveals this as a distinct industry cluster where AI adoption dynamics differ fundamentally from tech, manufacturing, or pharma. The product-is-human-expertise constraint creates unique structural tensions.

- **Attorney-exclusion firewall as potential mechanism**: Baker McKenzie's explicit exclusion of attorneys from AI-driven cuts may represent a broader pattern in professional services where core fee-earners are structurally protected while support functions absorb displacement. Worth watching for similar patterns in consulting, accounting, and financial advisory.

- **"Physical AI" as organizational category**: Both Arm Holdings and NVIDIA are creating dedicated "Physical AI" divisions, suggesting the semiconductor industry is institutionalizing a distinction between digital AI (cloud/software) and physical AI (robotics/embodied). This may represent an emerging habitat condition.

## Type Specimens Identified

None in this batch. All new specimens are stubs with single sources.

## Edge Cases

- **Forrester**: Is M6b+M5 the right classification? A research firm building an AI product to replace its own analysts doesn't map cleanly to any single model. The "cannibalizing your own core product with AI" pattern may need its own classification category.

- **Baker McKenzie**: The attorney-exclusion firewall creates a two-tier AI response within a single org. Is this M6a (enterprise-wide adoption) if a major function is explicitly excluded? Or is it a more nuanced pattern?
