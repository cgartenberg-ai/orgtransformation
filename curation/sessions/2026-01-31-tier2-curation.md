## Patterns Observed

1. **AI restructuring at scale continues:** Pinterest (-800), Dow (-4,500), UPS (-30,000) join Amazon (-16K+), Citigroup (-20K). Cumulative pattern of AI-driven workforce transformation.
2. **Dual AI leadership emerging:** Salesforce model of separate product AI teams + internal AI transformation officer. Hysen's DHS CAIO → Salesforce path is a new government-to-corporate pipeline.
3. **Platform companies as AI org architects:** Atlassian (Teamwork Graph + Rovo agents) and Mercor (AI-matched gig workforce) reshape how OTHER organizations structure their AI operations.
4. **AI-washing debate intensifying:** Pinterest's self-acknowledged risks and Axios 'AI-washing' critique raise questions about distinguishing genuine AI restructuring from cost-cutting.
5. **Industrial AI restructuring wave:** Dow's 'Transform to Outperform' at a 129-year-old company represents AI adoption hitting traditional manufacturing.
