## Patterns Observed

1. **AI-driven restructuring at profitable companies:** Amazon cutting jobs while posting record profits and $125B AI CapEx. This is strategic rebalancing, not distress.
2. **CDO vs. CAIO distinction:** Coca-Cola chose CDO (broader digital mandate) over CAIO (AI-specific). Different from the CAIO trend at UBS, CBA, UK Government.
3. **CoE at massive scale:** Infosys 100K-engineer CoE is an order of magnitude larger than typical CoEs. Scale changes the dynamics.
4. **CAIO role expanding into new sectors:** Academic medicine (CI MED), government (UK), joining corporate sector.
5. **Corporate venture studios for AI:** LG's WaveX model — corporate innovation center → external AI venture studio with public-private funding.
