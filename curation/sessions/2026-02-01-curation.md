## Reclassifications
None.

## Taxonomy Feedback

### CoE Model Fragmentation
NTT DATA's triple-CoE structure suggests Model 2 is fragmenting into specialized sub-types:
- **Client-facing CoE** (OpenAI CoE — builds AI services for external clients)
- **Internal operations CoE** (CIO office — manages enterprise AI integration)
- **Domain-specific CoE** (Virtual CoE for CX — focused vertical)

This parallels how Model 5 has sub-types (5a/5b/5c) and Model 6 has sub-types (6a/6b/6c). Model 2 may benefit from similar sub-type recognition.

### CAIO Pipeline Diversification
This session confirmed 3 distinct CAIO career pipelines:
1. **CTO-to-CAIO** (IndoStar/Kothari) — internal tech leadership promotion
2. **Consumer/enterprise tech-to-CAIO** (Invent/Zimmerman) — Microsoft Azure Black Belt → fintech CAIO (Mechanism #9)
3. **Enterprise IT-to-consulting CAIO** (PwC/Priest) — Toyota CIO → PwC cloud → PwC CAIO

### Management Delayering as Structural Pattern
Both UPS and Microsoft are explicitly targeting management layers. This pattern — AI automation reducing coordination complexity, enabling flatter structures — may warrant recognition as an emerging mechanism or a structural consequence worth tracking systematically.

### "Portfolio of Accountable Owners" Model
PwC's framework of CAIO evolving from single executive to distributed portfolio may represent an evolution of Model 2 (CoE) toward a federated governance model. Worth tracking as more organizations adopt this pattern.

## Type Specimens Identified
None.

## Edge Cases

### IndoStar — CoE or Solo CAIO?
Classified as Model 2 (CoE) because the CAIO role coordinates AI across business functions, but no evidence of a staffed team or center. May be closer to a governance-only role. More data needed.

### NTT DATA — IT Services Dual Tension
IT services firms serve both internal transformation AND client delivery, creating a dual explore/execute tension not captured well by the current taxonomy. The multi-CoE structure may be a response to this unique habitat condition.
