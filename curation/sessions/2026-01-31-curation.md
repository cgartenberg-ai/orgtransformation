## Updated Specimens (7)

| ID | What Changed |
|---|---|
| nvidia | +1 layer (CEO AI Philosophy from No Priors). Enriched habitat, contingencies, tensions. |
| anthropic | +2 layers (CEO/COO Structure, IPO Preparation). Confidence Medium->High. +4 quotes, +5 sources. |
| microsoft | +1 layer (Three-Tier Structure from Cheeky Pint Nadella). +3 quotes. Updated title. |
| eli-lilly | +1 layer (NVIDIA Co-Innovation Lab detailed sources). +4 sources, +1 quote. |
| salesforce | +1 layer (AI-Driven Workforce Restructuring). +5 sources. Fixed industry: Automotive->Technology. |
| openai-microsoft | +1 layer (PBC Restructuring & IPO Path). +6 sources. |
| tesla | +1 layer (Operation Maestro & AI Pivot). +1 source. |

## Evolutions (3)

| ID | Change | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| meta-ai | RECLASSIFIED Model 1->Model 4, secondary Model 1. Completeness->High. | MSL consolidation under Wang. 4-unit structure = hub-and-spoke. LeCun departure signals research autonomy lost. 8+ sources. |
| ubs | Orientation Contextual->Structural. Completeness->Medium. | Chief AI Office is a structurally distinct unit with dedicated CAIO role, not contextual AI adoption. |
| commonwealth-bank | Added secondary Model 2 (CoE). | CAIO appointment adds formal governance layer atop enterprise-wide adoption. |

## Skipped

| Org | Reason |
|---|---|
| illinois-state | No dedicated section in session file. Only mentioned in CAIO trends sidebar. Insufficient data. |

## Classification Decisions

- **Intercom (Temporal)**: Only the 2nd Temporal specimen (after Samsung C-Lab). 72-hour roadmap pivot is a clear time-based switching pattern.
- **Meta reclassification**: Model 1->4 is the first major reclassification in the herbarium. Documents what happens when a Research Lab is subordinated to product-driven leadership.
- **Wells Fargo (business leader as AI chief)**: Distinct CAIO pattern -- consumer banking CEO given AI mandate rather than technologist.
- **AMI Labs vs Meta**: LeCun's departure from Meta and founding of AMI Labs creates a linked pair of specimens documenting the explore/exploit tension.

## Taxonomy Feedback Collected

1. **Workforce recomposition pattern** (Salesforce): AI doesn't just reduce headcount, it reshapes workforce composition. Taxonomy doesn't capture this.
2. **Repeated reorgs cost** (Meta): Excessive structural flexibility has costs. Taxonomy doesn't capture organizational instability.
3. **Decentralized vs centralized Research Labs** (Eli Lilly): Hub federation model is distinct from single Research Lab.
4. **Narrative management** (Salesforce): Benioff publicly downplayed AI job displacement 2 months before cutting 4,000 jobs.
5. **Counter-example for Mechanism #1** (Meta): When CEO stops protecting research autonomy, chief scientist leaves.
