# Curation Session: Deep Scan

**Date:** 2026-01-31
**Session file:** `research/sessions/2026-01-31-deep-scan-session.md`
**Curator:** Claude (Phase 2 automated curation)
**Specimens processed:** 5 (3 new, 2 evolutions)

## Summary

Deep-scan session processing high-priority podcast episodes triaged in previous sessions. Created 3 new specimens from podcast deep-scans and press. Added evolution layers to 2 existing specimens (Microsoft, Google DeepMind) with rich primary source data from Dwarkesh and Acquired podcasts.

## New Specimens

### ssi — Safe Superintelligence Inc. (SSI)
- **Classification:** Model 1 (Research Lab), Structural
- **Key data:** Pure research company — no products, no sales, all compute on research. $3B funding. Sutskever's "age of research" philosophy. Mechanism #1 (Protect Off-Strategy Work).
- **Sources:** 1 podcast deep-scan (Dwarkesh — Sutskever)
- **Completeness:** Low

### sierra-ai — Sierra AI
- **Classification:** Model 5a (Product/Venture Lab), Structural — Low confidence
- **Key data:** AI agent company with outcome-based pricing. Co-founded by Bret Taylor (ex-Salesforce co-CEO) + Clay Bavor (ex-Google 18yr). Internal AI-first culture.
- **Sources:** 1 podcast deep-scan (Acquired ACQ2 — Taylor/Bavor)
- **Completeness:** Low

### citigroup — Citigroup
- **Classification:** Model 6a (Enterprise-Wide Adoption), Contextual — Low confidence, Stub
- **Key data:** CFO expects -20K headcount via AI automation of middle-office functions. Part of financial services AI restructuring wave.
- **Sources:** 1 press source
- **Completeness:** Low (Stub)

## Evolution Updates

### microsoft — Microsoft
- **Change:** Added layer: "Dual Model Source & Vertical Product Teams" from Dwarkesh Nadella deep-scan. Key new data: dual model source (OpenAI external + MAI internal), product-vertical teams (security, knowledge work, coding, science), key AI talent acquisitions (Suleyman, Subramanya from Gemini, de Freitas from DeepMind), Fairwater 2 datacenter (2GW+), 10x training capacity every 18-24 months.
- **New sources:** 1 podcast deep-scan (Dwarkesh — Nadella)
- **New quotes:** 2 (model dual source, ROIC philosophy)

### google-deepmind — Google DeepMind
- **Change:** Added layer: "Historical AI Org Evolution" from Acquired deep-scan. 25-year arc documented: decentralized (2001-2009) → X incubator (2009) → Brain team (2011, Dean/Ng/Corrado) → DNN Research acquisition ($44M, Hinton/Krizhevsky/Sutskever) → DeepMind acquisition ($550M, kept separate in London) → dual structure (Brain = products, DeepMind = AGI) → Rosewood dinner → Sutskever → OpenAI (2015) → Gemini response → 450M users.
- **New sources:** 1 podcast deep-scan (Acquired — Google: The AI Company)

## Registry Impact

- **New specimens:** 3 (ssi, sierra-ai, citigroup)
- **Total specimens:** 71 → 74
- **byModel changes:** 1: 10→11 (+ssi), 5: 9→10 (+sierra-ai), 6: 9→10 (+citigroup)
- **byOrientation changes:** Contextual: 19→20, Structural: 50→52
- **Evolutions:** microsoft layerCount 2→3, google-deepmind layerCount 2→3

## Patterns Observed

1. **Pure research lab as organizational choice:** SSI deliberately has zero product/sales function. Sutskever argues this concentrates compute advantage vs. competitors who dilute across products. Strongest Model 1 specimen.
2. **Microsoft's dual model strategy:** OpenAI partnership + internal MAI team = hedged model capability. Organizational implications: two model supply chains require coordination.
3. **Google's 25-year explore/execute arc:** The most complete structural evolution narrative in the collection. Each phase represents a different balance between exploration and execution.
4. **Financial services AI restructuring wave:** Citigroup (-20K) joins UBS, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan, CBA in sector-wide AI-driven organizational change.
