# Curation Session: 2026-02-12

## Session Type
Add Layer to Existing Specimens — processing 6 enrichment agent outputs from `research/pending/enrich-*.json`

## Specimens Created/Updated

| Organization | Action | Previous | New Model | Orientation | Confidence | Notes |
|--------------|--------|----------|-----------|-------------|------------|-------|
| Thomson Reuters | Reclassified | M6a/Contextual/Low | M4 + M5 (secondary) | Structural | Medium | Platform+embedded model. TR Labs (decades-old R&D) as hub. CTO Joel Hron (acqui-hire from ThoughtTrace). 8 acquisitions in 2 years. Open Arena 20K users. $200M+ annual AI spend. |
| CrowdStrike | Classified | null/null/Low | M3 | Structural | Medium | CTO Elia Zaitsev owns AI/ML. Charlotte AI multi-agent architecture (12+ agents). CTO/CTIO split creates dual exploration lanes. 500 layoffs framed as AI efficiency. "Security AGI" aspiration. |
| Recruit Holdings | Reclassified | M6/null/Low | M3 | Contextual | Medium | Dual-hat CEO (parent+subsidiary). Glassdoor absorbed into Indeed. AI embedded in product/engineering (EVP Mukherjee). AI writes 1/3 of code (targeting 50%). ~4,500 cut over 3 years. |
| HP Inc. | Reclassified | M6/Contextual/Low | M4 + M5 (secondary) | Structural | Medium | Three AI pillars: HP IQ (Humane acqui-hire lab), HP Labs (CTO Kurtoglu), divisional embedding. $116M acquisition. CEO Lores departed Feb 2026 — major uncertainty. |
| Panasonic | Reclassified | M2/Structural/Low | M4 + M5 (secondary) | Structural | Medium | Group CAIO (Sakakibara, April 2026). Blue Yonder subsidiary (20B daily predictions). Business CEO dual-hat mechanism. PX-AI to 180K employees. ConnectAI since Feb 2023. |
| Kyndryl | Enriched | M2/Structural/Low | M2 (confirmed) | Structural | Medium | Practice-based model. Applications, Data and AI practice under Bradshaw (ex-CIO). Cross-functional governance committee. Alliance-driven agents (100 in 100 days). Under financial pressure. |

## Classification Summary

**Reclassifications:**
- 3 specimens moved from M6 to M4 (Thomson Reuters, HP Inc.) or M3 (Recruit Holdings) — all were initially classified from thin single-source data
- 1 specimen classified from null (CrowdStrike → M3)
- 1 specimen reclassified from M2 to M4 (Panasonic)
- 1 specimen confirmed at M2 with upgraded confidence (Kyndryl)

**Net model distribution changes:**
- M2: 21 → 20 (-1: Panasonic left)
- M3: 9 → 11 (+2: CrowdStrike, Recruit Holdings)
- M4: 59 → 62 (+3: Thomson Reuters, HP Inc., Panasonic)
- M6: 24 → 21 (-3: Thomson Reuters, Recruit Holdings, HP Inc.)

**Key pattern:** Initial M6 (Unnamed/Informal) classifications from workforce-reduction-only sources were overwhelmingly wrong. Of the 4 M6 specimens enriched this session, all 4 were reclassified to M3 or M4 after discovering named AI units and structural detail. **Workforce reduction announcements are poor signals of organizational structure.**

## Taxonomy Feedback

### Cross-Cutting Patterns
1. **Acqui-hire-to-CTO pipeline**: Both Thomson Reuters (ThoughtTrace → Hron → CTO) and HP Inc. (Humane → HP IQ lab) use acquisitions to populate AI leadership. This is Mechanism #9 operating at team level.
2. **Dual-hat CEO for AI**: Recruit Holdings (parent CEO takes subsidiary CEO) and Panasonic (Business CEO mechanism) both use leadership dual-hatting to bridge exploration and execution — different implementations of the same coordination problem.
3. **Services firm classification challenge**: Kyndryl's AI structure is primarily about client delivery, not internal transformation. The taxonomy may need a habitat tag for services firms.
4. **CTO-vs-CTIO split**: CrowdStrike's separation of operational AI (CTO) from innovation (CTIO) creates two exploration lanes within M3. The taxonomy doesn't capture this embedded-team internal differentiation.

### Guardrails Applied
- Guardrail 2 (Federation): Applied to Thomson Reuters, HP Inc., Panasonic — confirmed M4 in all cases
- Guardrail 3 (Research vs. Structure): Applied to CrowdStrike — confirmed M3
- Guardrail 6 (One-Time vs. Temporal): Applied to Recruit Holdings — confirmed Contextual, not Temporal

## Edge Cases
- **Thomson Reuters**: Simultaneously M4 internally (platform + embedded) and M5 externally (CoCounsel, Westlaw products at 28% ACV). Dual-track pattern.
- **HP Inc.**: CEO departure creates natural experiment — will AI structure persist under new leadership?
- **Panasonic**: Longest time horizon in collection (30% AI revenue by 2035 = 9-year target)
