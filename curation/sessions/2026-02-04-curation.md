## Process Notes
This was the first **parallel curation session** — 4 background agents ran simultaneously, each assigned a different research session. Overlapping specimens (Meta appeared in sessions 001/002/003; Microsoft in sessions 001/003) were assigned to the agent with the richest data (Meta→Session 002, Microsoft→Session 003). Other agents were instructed to skip those orgs.

The parallel approach successfully completed most work but 2 new specimens (workday, rwjbarnabas-health) and 4 existing specimen updates (infosys, anthropic, publicis-groupe enrichments) were not completed by agents — likely due to context limits. These were completed manually in the main session.

The curation protocol was updated with a new "Parallel Curation with Overlapping Specimens" section before this session began.
