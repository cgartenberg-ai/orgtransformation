# Type Specimens

Type specimens are the clearest, best-documented examples of each structural model. Use them as reference points when classifying.

## Model 1: Research Lab
**Type Specimen: DeepMind**
- Pure research mission, 5-10 year horizons
- Publications as primary output
- AlphaFold, Gemini contributions
- Structurally separated from Google's product orgs

## Model 2: Center of Excellence
**Type Specimen: [TBD - need clear example]**
- Governance and enablement focus
- Doesn't build products directly
- Sets standards, provides training
- Measures adoption, compliance

## Model 3: Embedded Teams
**Type Specimen: [TBD - need clear example]**
- No central AI function
- AI capabilities within product teams
- Product KPIs as success metrics
- Quarterly planning cycles

## Model 4: Hybrid/Hub-and-Spoke
**Type Specimen: Novo Nordisk**
- Central AI hub (300-person team)
- Spoke deployment to business units
- Hub sets standards, spokes execute
- Dual KPI structure (central + BU)

## Model 5: Product/Venture Lab
**Type Specimen (5b): Google X**
- 100+ experiments annually
- 2% graduation rate to independent companies
- Waymo, Verily, Wing as outputs
- Clear graduation criteria and handoff

**Type Specimen (5c): Walmart GoLocal**
- Internal route optimization tool
- Franz Edelman Award for internal use
- Productized and sold externally
- Internal advantage → revenue stream

## Model 6: Unnamed/Informal
**Type Specimen (6a): Bank of America**
- 95% of 213K employees use AI daily
- No formal "AI Lab" branding
- Erica extended to employees
- Enterprise-wide adoption, top-down

**Type Specimen (6b): P&G ChatPG**
- 30,000+ active users
- Central team, informal name
- Rejected pilots, went company-wide
- No formal lab structure

## Model 7: Tiger Teams
**Type Specimen: Samsung C-Lab**
- Employees leave roles for time-limited exploration
- 100+ graduated startups since 2012
- 20% become independent companies
- Clear exit: back to operations or out to venture

*Type specimens should be updated as better examples are documented. The ideal type specimen has: clear structural model fit, rich documentation, multiple sources, specific metrics, and leadership quotes explaining rationale.*
