# Type Specimens

Type specimens are the clearest, best-documented examples of each structural model. Use them as reference points when classifying.

## Model 1: Research Lab
**Type Specimen: DeepMind**
- Pure research mission, 5-10 year horizons
- Publications as primary output
- AlphaFold, Gemini contributions
- Structurally separated from Google's product orgs

## Model 2: Center of Excellence
**Type Specimen: [TBD - need clear example]**
- Governance and enablement focus
- Doesn't build products directly
- Sets standards, provides training
- Measures adoption, compliance

## Model 3: Embedded Teams
**Type Specimen: [TBD - need clear example]**
- No central AI function
- AI capabilities within product teams
- Product KPIs as success metrics
- Quarterly planning cycles

## Model 4: Hybrid/Hub-and-Spoke
**Type Specimen: Novo Nordisk**
- Central AI hub (300-person team)
- Spoke deployment to business units
- Hub sets standards, spokes execute
- Dual KPI structure (central + BU)

**Additional Reference: Eli Lilly (Decentralized Hubs)**
- Multiple 300-400 person hubs, each focused on a therapeutic area
- Hubs operate like internal biotechs, coordinated by central R&D leadership
- Reclassified from M1 — multiple distributed units with central coordination = M4, not M1
- $1B NVIDIA co-innovation lab adds M5b (Venture Builder) secondary dimension

## Model 5: Product/Venture Lab
**Type Specimen (5a): Samsung C-Lab**
- Permanent internal incubator (13+ years, since 2012)
- Venture-style selection, full-year employee rotations
- 20% of projects become independent companies (959 total ventures)
- Temporal orientation: individuals cycle between exploration and execution
- Reclassified from M7 — permanence and pipeline make it M5, not M7

**Type Specimen (5b): Google X**
- 100+ experiments annually
- 2% graduation rate to independent companies
- Waymo, Verily, Wing as outputs
- Clear graduation criteria and handoff

**Type Specimen (5c): Walmart GoLocal**
- Internal route optimization tool
- Franz Edelman Award for internal use
- Productized and sold externally
- Internal advantage → revenue stream

## Model 6: Unnamed/Informal
**Type Specimen (6a): Bank of America**
- 95% of 213K employees use AI daily
- No formal "AI Lab" branding
- Erica extended to employees
- Enterprise-wide adoption, top-down

**Type Specimen (6b): P&G ChatPG**
- 30,000+ active users
- Central team, informal name
- Rejected pilots, went company-wide
- No formal lab structure

## Model 7: Tiger Teams
**Type Specimen: [TBD — no current type specimen]**
- Ad hoc, temporary structures only (not permanent programs)
- Employees leave roles for time-limited exploration
- Clear exit: back to operations or project termination
- Note: Samsung C-Lab was reclassified to M5a (permanent program with temporal cycling)

## Model 8: Skunkworks (Emerging)
**Type Specimen: [None yet]**
- Semi-autonomous unit reimagining an existing business line with AI
- Distinguished from M5 by structural potential: positioned to replace the mothership, not build adjacent
- No company will publicly frame this as cannibalization — infer from structure, not stated intent
- Orientation typically Temporal (transitioning from old way to new way)
- Watch for: Google DeepMind (potential candidate as Gemini absorbs core product functions)
- Pattern reported in executive conversations but no confirmed specimen as of 2026-02

*Type specimens should be updated as better examples are documented. The ideal type specimen has: clear structural model fit, rich documentation, multiple sources, specific metrics, and leadership quotes explaining rationale.*
