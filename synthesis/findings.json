Cross-industry variation exceeds within-industry variation. The same structural form (M4 hub-and-spoke) serves different functions depending on industry: in pharma the hub drives exploration (drug discovery), in finance the hub drives execution (productivity deployment). Convergence is strongest where constraints are tightest (automotive: 100% M4); divergence appears where constraints permit multiple equilibria (aerospace/defense, telecom).",

Organizations that achieve coherence between structural choices and rhetorical choices execute more effectively than those where structure and rhetoric are misaligned. The complementarity operates through rhetorical division of labor mirroring structural division, survival rhetoric substituting for structural absence, sector institutions constraining both simultaneously, rhetorical distance signaling structural misalignment, heritage-as-authorization reducing political cost, and counter-positioning extending to rhetoric.",
