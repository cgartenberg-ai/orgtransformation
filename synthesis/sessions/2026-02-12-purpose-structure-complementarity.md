# Field Journal: Purpose-Structure Complementarity

**Date:** February 12, 2026 (Session 22)
**Type:** Collaborative analytical session — botanist hat
**Trigger:** Reviewing the accumulated purpose claims insights (1,082 claims across 51 specimens) led to a reframing of the entire purpose claims track from "diagnostic tool" to "complementary organizational response."

---

## The Reframing

The previous framing of purpose claims insights centered on **diagnosis**: purpose rhetoric as a *window into* organizational structure. "The rhetorical division of labor mirrors structural division" — rhetoric reveals structure. "Survival rhetoric signals structural absence" — rhetoric diagnoses structural weakness.

The collaborator's instinct was right: **we care less about purpose as a diagnostic tool and more about the complementary role of purpose and organizational design choices.** This is a fundamentally different theoretical claim:

- **Old framing**: Purpose claims → diagnostic signal → reveals structure
- **New framing**: Purpose claims + structure → complementary practices → jointly constitute the organization's transformation response

The difference matters because the new framing is a *Milgrom & Roberts (1990, 1995) complementarities argument*: the returns to structural investment in AI exploration depend on the accompanying rhetorical investment, and vice versa. Organizations that achieve coherence between structure and rhetoric should outperform those where the two are misaligned. This is testable, it connects to our theoretical framework (org economics, not sociology), and it elevates purpose claims from a methodological curiosity to a core analytical contribution.

## What Changed

### 1. Rhetorical Division of Labor → Purpose-Structure Co-Production (AMENDED)

**Before:** "The pattern suggests that purpose claims are not just strategic communication — they are structural artifacts."

**After:** "Purpose rhetoric and organizational structure are co-produced responses to the same organizational challenge. Structure allocates decision rights; purpose rhetoric allocates meaning-making rights."

The key move: from rhetoric *revealing* structure to rhetoric and structure being *jointly determined*. Toyota doesn't have rhetorical separation because it has structural separation — it has both because Toyota designed both coherently. Ford has structural separation (Latitude AI exists) but NOT rhetorical separation (Farley monopolizes all purpose claims, Field is silent) — and this misalignment is a *predicted failure condition*, not just an observation.

**New testable implication:** Organizations with complementary structural + rhetorical division (Toyota, Honeywell) will show better AI exploration outcomes than those with misaligned division (Ford: structural separation + rhetorical monopoly).

### 2. Survival Rhetoric → Rhetorical Substitution (AMENDED + PROMOTED)

**Before (hypothesis):** "Survival rhetoric is inversely correlated with structural exploration investment."

**After (emerging):** "Survival rhetoric is a *functional substitute* for structural response. Organizations allocate their transformation effort across two channels — structural and rhetorical. When one is weak, the other must compensate."

The upgrade from correlation to substitution is important. It's not that Ford uses survival rhetoric *because* it lacks structure (passive correlation). It's that Ford uses survival rhetoric *in place of* structure (active substitution). The survival rhetoric is doing the organizational work — creating urgency, authorizing resource reallocation, justifying disruption — that a structural response (like BMW's Neue Klasse commitment) would do if Ford had one.

**Promoted from hypothesis to emerging** because the pattern now holds across 4 automotive specimens plus cross-industry evidence.

**Longitudinal prediction:** Survival rhetoric should *decrease* as structural solutions are built. This is testable via earnings call time series. If Ford announces a major structural AI commitment, Farley's survival rhetoric should drop in subsequent quarters.

### 3. Sector Rhetorical Signatures → Institutional Boundary Conditions (AMENDED)

Added crucial paragraph: the institutional constraints that limit rhetorical registers ALSO limit structural choices. Physical production constraints (unions, supply chains, safety regulation) both prevent utopian rhetoric AND prevent aggressive structural experimentation (M8 skunkworks, rapid pivots). The rhetorical constraints and structural constraints are two expressions of the same institutional boundary conditions.

**Implication for the complementarities argument:** Purpose-structure complementarity operates differently in industrial vs. tech sectors — not because complementarity doesn't hold, but because the *feasible set of complementary pairs is narrower*. Industrial firms can't pair utopian rhetoric with M8 skunkworks. Their complementary pairs are necessarily more conservative:
- BMW: identity rhetoric + embedded AI
- Toyota: teleological rhetoric + M4 hub
- Ford: survival rhetoric + workforce restructuring

### 4. Inverse Grove → Added Rhetorical Signature (AMENDED)

The Inverse Grove now has a detectable rhetorical signature: when the CEO's purpose claims are far from operational leaders' claims — utopian vs. commercial-success — the organization is likely in inverse Grove territory. Benioff's "digital labor revolution" vs. the Agentforce team's deterministic Agent Script recalibration. Zipse's "BMW IS the Neue Klasse" vs. the implicit factory-floor reality of integration.

**The rhetorical distance between CEO and operational leaders is a measurable proxy for degree of inverse Grove.** This makes the inverse Grove hypothesis testable via purpose claims data alone.

### 5. Purpose-Structure Complementarity (NEW — the overarching insight)

This is the big one. It synthesizes all four amended insights plus the CEO silence spectrum and Coasean claims into a single theoretical argument:

**Organizations that achieve coherence between structural design choices and purpose rhetoric — where decision rights and meaning-making rights are coherently allocated — should outperform those where the two are misaligned.**

Five mechanisms through which complementarity operates:
1. Rhetorical division mirrors structural division (Toyota, Honeywell)
2. Survival rhetoric substitutes for structural response (Ford, vs. BMW)
3. Sector institutions constrain both simultaneously (no utopian + no M8 in industrial)
4. Rhetorical distance signals structural misalignment (Salesforce, inverse Grove)
5. Counter-positioning extends to rhetoric (SAP/BMW = infrastructure + identity vs. Salesforce/Tesla = actor + utopian)

**Theoretical anchor:** Milgrom & Roberts (1990, 1995) on complementary practices. Brynjolfsson & Milgrom (2013) on IT requiring complementary organizational redesign. Gibbons & Henderson (2012) on relational contracts. The argument is: just as IT investment requires complementary organizational redesign, AI transformation requires complementary *rhetorical* redesign. Purpose rhetoric is a relational contract that makes structural choices credible and sustainable.

### 6. CEO Silence Spectrum (NEW)

The range from sole-voice (Uber: 16/16 from Khosrowshahi) to total silence (Nike: 0 from Hill) is itself a complementary design choice:

| Position | Example | Structural Complement |
|----------|---------|----------------------|
| Sole-voice CEO | Uber, Anduril, Disney | CEO IS the exploration mandate; no separate AI exploration unit |
| Distributed speakers | Toyota, Honeywell | AI organizationally distributed; meaning-making rights distributed with decision rights |
| CEO silence | Nike | AI deliberately subordinated to other priorities; structural de-emphasis matches rhetorical de-emphasis |

**Nike is the collection's strongest evidence of negative complementarity**: Hill's rhetorical silence and the elimination of the CTO role are complementary moves that jointly constitute Nike's decision that AI is NOT a CEO-level strategic concern. The structural decision (killing the CTO role) *enacts* the rhetorical choice.

**Connects to Aghion & Tirole (1997):** Formal vs. real authority. CEOs may retain formal authority over AI purpose narratives while delegating real authority over AI decisions, or vice versa. The silence spectrum reveals which.

### 7. Coasean Purpose Claims (NEW)

A small but analytically invaluable class of purpose claims where leaders, whether knowingly or not, theorize organizational boundaries:

- **Uber — Khosrowshahi:** "What's a company? Essentially, it's a rule." Practically a Coase (1937) paraphrase. If AI can "reason through every possible scenario," the coordination rationale for the firm dissolves.
- **Microsoft — Nadella:** Has explicitly referenced Coase's theory of the firm. The only CEO who cites the academic literature by name.
- **McKinsey — Sternfels:** "60K entities" (40K humans + 25K AI agents). If 42% of your "employees" are software, what is the boundary of the firm?

These are rare but analytically invaluable because they're where practitioner language most closely approaches the academic conversation we're contributing to. We should flag these systematically going forward.

**Also watch for anti-Coasean claims** — leaders who argue that AI makes the firm MORE necessary (because AI requires more organizational coordination, not less). These would be the Williamson (1975) response to the Coase argument.

## The Analytical Arc

Looking back at the purpose claims track from 30,000 feet:

1. **Sessions 1-4 (Pilot → Batch 2):** Data collection. Discovered the transcript gap. Built the scanning infrastructure.
2. **Sessions 5-7 (Batches 3-7):** Taxonomy revision (v1.0 → v2.0). Quantity scaling (59 → 337 claims).
3. **Session 8 (Taxonomy v2.0):** Analytical session. Realized v1.0 mixed genuine types with surface categories.
4. **Sessions 18-20 (Batches 7-9):** First cross-cutting analytical insights emerge — sector rhetorical signatures, survival-structure correlation, rhetorical division of labor, Inverse Grove.
5. **Session 22 (this session):** The complementarity reframing. Purpose and structure as co-produced, not purpose as diagnostic.

The trajectory is: collection → classification → pattern recognition → theoretical reframing. We're now in the theoretical reframing phase, which is where the academic contribution lives.

## What This Means for the Papers

### Paper 1 (Structural paper — the field guide)
Purpose-structure complementarity becomes a core analytical dimension. When presenting structural models (M1-M9), we should also present the *rhetorical complements* that make each model work. M4 hub-and-spoke works best with rhetorical delegation. M6 informal works best with CEO silence or sole-voice pragmatism.

### Paper 2 (Purpose claims paper)
The complementarities framing gives this paper a theoretical spine. It's not just "here's what CEOs say about AI" — it's "purpose rhetoric and organizational structure are complementary practices, and coherence between them predicts transformation effectiveness." The Milgrom & Roberts anchor makes this an org economics paper, not a communications paper.

### Potential Paper 3 (Inverse Grove)
The rhetorical signature of inverse Grove (CEO purpose claims far from operational reality) makes this testable via purpose claims data + structural data. Could be a standalone empirical paper: "When Leaders Outrun Their Organizations: Detecting Top-Down Transformation Overreach via Purpose Rhetoric."

## Open Questions

1. **Is the complementarity measurable?** Can we construct a "purpose-structure coherence score" for each specimen based on: (a) whether rhetorical division matches structural division, (b) whether survival rhetoric inversely correlates with structural investment within the specimen, (c) whether CEO silence matches structural de-emphasis? If so, we can test the super-modularity prediction directly.

2. **Does complementarity change over time?** When organizations restructure (new CAIO, new AI unit), how quickly does rhetoric adjust? Is there a measurable lag? The earnings call time series could test this.

3. **Are Coasean claims predictive?** Leaders who theorize firm boundaries (Khosrowshahi, Nadella) — do they make different structural choices than leaders who don't? Specifically, do Coasean thinkers favor more modular structural models (because they see AI as dissolving the coordination rationale for internal hierarchy)?

4. **What's the anti-Coasean claim?** We have Coasean claims (AI dissolves the firm). Are there claims where leaders argue AI makes the firm MORE necessary? These would be the Williamson response — AI increases the need for relationship-specific investment and internal governance. We should look for these, especially in high-tacitness industries (pharma, healthcare).

5. **Does founder status drive the silence spectrum?** Both sole-voice monopolists in this batch (Uber, Anduril) have founder-like authority. Is sole-voice concentration a *founder* phenomenon, not a *strategic priority* phenomenon? If so, the CEO silence spectrum has a different causal interpretation.

## Specimens to Watch

| Specimen | Why Watch | Expected Pattern |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Ford | Predicted misalignment case | If Farley delegates meaning-making to Latitude AI leader, that's a move toward complementarity |
| Salesforce | Inverse Grove case | If Agentforce quality improves, Benioff's rhetoric should become less utopian and more operational |
| Nike | Negative complementarity case | If Nike appoints a new CTO or AI leader, watch for Hill to begin making AI claims |
| Pfizer | Untested pharma case | Does Bourla vs. Kowalski show the same rhetorical-structural mirroring as Toyota? |
| JPMorgan | Untested finserv case | Does Dimon vs. Heitsenrether show rhetorical division? Dimon's "too important for technology" is itself a structural-rhetorical claim |
| Goldman Sachs | Anti-Coasean candidate? | Goldman's deliberate opacity + infrastructure positioning might generate anti-Coasean claims (AI makes the firm's information advantage MORE important, not less) |
