# Synthesis Session: 2026-02-09 (Batch 2 — Finance Remainder + Insurance + Pharma)

## Session Context

Processing 10 specimens across three sectors: **Finance remainder** (3: Bank of America, Wells Fargo, UBS), **Insurance** (2: Progressive, Travelers), and **Pharma** (5: Eli Lilly, Moderna, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, Roche-Genentech). Nine have prior synthesis and were re-queued after overnight enrichment; Progressive is brand new.

This batch is analytically rich because it places the **pharma sector** against the **finance sector** from Batch 1. Both are high-regulation industries but face the ambidexterity tension differently: finance is primarily deploying AI for productivity and risk management (execution-oriented), while pharma is primarily deploying AI for drug discovery (exploration-oriented). Insurance sits between them — regulated like finance but with an actuarial/data tradition that creates a distinctive structural pattern.

**Key analytical question:** Does hub-and-spoke (M4) in pharma serve a fundamentally different organizational function than M4 in finance?

**Specimens processed:**

|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| #1 Protect Off-Strategy Work | Eli Lilly Q4 2025 earnings reinforce CEO shielding of R&D hubs | eli-lilly (already in, evidence enriched) |
| #3 Embed Product at Research Frontier | NVIDIA co-innovation lab adds "scientist-in-the-loop" evidence; Pfizer CSO describes embedding AI engineers in each R&D function | eli-lilly (already in), pfizer (already in) |
| #4 Consumer-Grade UX | Bank of America Erica → Erica for Employees (20.6M consumer users, 90%+ employee adoption) — strongest single-company evidence of consumer→enterprise UX transfer | bank-of-america (already in) |

Wells Fargo: 30-35% automation target + $612M severance signals management layer reduction. | moderna (**new to mechanism**), wells-fargo (**new to mechanism**) |

### Evidence Notes (Not Added — Already in Synthesis)

- Bank of America (#4, #5), Wells Fargo (#5, #8), UBS (#8), Travelers (#5, #8), Eli Lilly (#1, #3), Moderna (#5), Novo Nordisk (#5), Pfizer (#3), Roche-Genentech (#3) — all already have evidence entries in mechanisms.json from prior synthesis rounds. Q4 2025 earnings enrichment doesn't change the mechanism classification but deepens the evidence quality.

### Candidates Identified

| Candidate | Evidence Count | Confidence |
|-----------|----------------|------------|
| Pharma-NVIDIA Partnership Pattern | 2 (Eli Lilly $1B lab, Roche-Genentech multi-year collaboration) | Low — need 3rd specimen |

**Note:** Eli Lilly ($1B NVIDIA co-innovation lab) and Roche-Genentech (multi-year NVIDIA AI research collaboration) both partnered with NVIDIA specifically for AI drug discovery. This may represent a pharma-specific structural pattern where the GPU infrastructure provider becomes a structural partner rather than a vendor. Not yet a mechanism (only 2 specimens), but worth tracking. If Pfizer or another pharma company announces a similar NVIDIA partnership, this would reach the 3-specimen threshold.

### Candidate Progress: Governance Hub + Vendor Spokes

Progressive is a potential 3rd specimen for the "Governance Hub + Vendor Spokes" candidate mechanism (currently 2 specimens: Sutter Health, CVS Health). Progressive's buy-over-build approach (H2O.ai, Claritas) with internal governance suggests this pattern. However, Progressive's evidence is thinner — it's more "vendor-dependent" than "governance hub." **Decision: do NOT add Progressive to this candidate yet. The pattern in Sutter/CVS is governance-led vendor coordination; Progressive is vendor-dependent without clear evidence of governance sophistication.** Need a clearer 3rd specimen.

### Candidates Promoted to Mechanisms

None.

## Tensions Analysis

### Tension 1: Structural Separation vs. Contextual Integration

**New positions added:**

| Specimen | Position | Evidence |
|----------|----------|----------|
| progressive | 0.6 | No CAIO, no named lab, no dedicated AI team. AI embedded through vendor tools (H2O.ai, Claritas) across business functions. Contextual adoption without structural separation. |
| moderna | 0.8 | Already scored — verified. Enterprise-wide adoption, 100% proficiency mandate, no named AI unit. Maximum contextual integration. |
| novo-nordisk | -0.3 | Already scored — verified. 300-person hub is structural, but "Make Your Time Count" Copilot deployment is contextual. Mixed. |
| pfizer | -0.5 | Already scored — verified. CAIO, Fab Lab, Incubator = structural separation. Embedded AI engineers = structural spokes. |
| roche-genentech | -0.6 | Already scored — verified. gRED Computational Sciences as structural entity embedded in research. |
| bank-of-america | 0.4 | Already scored — verified. Type specimen for M6a contextual. Enterprise-wide Erica, no separate AI lab. |
| wells-fargo | -0.5 | Already scored — verified. Business leader heads dedicated AI function. Structural. |
| ubs | -0.6 | Already scored — verified. Chief AI Office with centralized governance. |
| eli-lilly | -0.8 | Already scored — verified. Structurally separated hubs. |
| travelers | -0.5 | Already scored — verified. TravAI as centralized platform. |

**Only Progressive is new.** Other specimens were already scored in prior synthesis.

### Tension 2: Speed of Deployment vs. Depth of Learning

**New positions added:**

| Specimen | Position | Evidence |
|----------|----------|----------|
| progressive | 0.0 | Balanced — 20-year data depth (telematics, actuarial) but commodity AI tools (H2O.ai, Claritas) deployed for speed. Depth in data, speed in tooling. |

Other specimens already scored from prior synthesis.

### Tension 3: Central Control vs. Distributed Autonomy

**New positions added:**

| Specimen | Position | Evidence |
|----------|----------|----------|
| progressive | 0.5 | No centralized AI function. Tech-first culture distributes AI decisions to business functions. IT serves as enabler, not controller. |

### Tension 4: Named Lab vs. Quiet Transformation

**New positions added:**

| Specimen | Position | Evidence |
|----------|----------|----------|
| progressive | 0.7 | Maximum quiet transformation in insurance. No CAIO, no named AI unit, no branded AI platform. AI is invisible infrastructure — "the company is a tech company that sells insurance." |

### Tension 5: Long Time Horizons vs. Short Accountability Cycles

**New positions added:**

| Specimen | Position | Evidence |
|----------|----------|----------|
| progressive | 0.1 | 20-year telematics data foundation suggests long-term orientation, but buy-over-build tooling and no named research agenda suggest near-term deployment focus. Slightly short-cycle. |

---

## Contingencies Identified/Updated

| Contingency | New Insight |
|-------------|-------------|
| regulatoryIntensity | Progressive added to "High" — insurance is high regulatory intensity, and Progressive's actuarial/telematics data discipline is compliance-shaped. |
| timeToObsolescence | Progressive added to "Medium" — insurance core business is not directly threatened by AI but will be reshaped by it (telematics pricing, automated underwriting). |
| ceoTenure | Novo Nordisk CEO transition (Doustdar replaced Jorgensen July 2025) creates uncertainty about AI governance continuity. CAIO was established under prior CEO. |
| talentMarketPosition | Progressive added to "Low" — no evidence of AI talent attraction strategy; buy-over-build approach suggests talent-constrained. |
| technicalDebt | Progressive added to "Low" — tech-first insurer with 20-year digital data foundation. |

## Convergent Evolution Observed

### Pattern 1: Pharma Hub-and-Spoke with NVIDIA Partnerships

| Pattern | Organizations | Significance |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| Central AI hub + NVIDIA GPU partnership for drug discovery | Eli Lilly ($1B co-innovation lab), Roche-Genentech (multi-year collaboration), Pfizer (1,200 GPUs) | Three pharma companies independently built central AI hubs that partner with NVIDIA specifically for computational drug discovery. The convergence suggests NVIDIA has become structural infrastructure for pharma AI — not just a vendor but a partner embedded in the organizational form. |

**Why this matters for ambidexterity:** The NVIDIA partnership creates a new type of boundary-spanning structure — the pharma company provides domain expertise (drug targets, clinical data) and the GPU provider provides computational capability. This is different from traditional outsourcing because the partnership is co-located and ongoing, not transactional. Eli Lilly's South San Francisco co-innovation lab is the clearest example: scientists from both firms work together, creating a continuous learning loop.

### Pattern 2: Insurance Data Moat as AI Foundation

| Pattern | Organizations | Significance |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| Decades of actuarial data discipline → AI-ready data foundation | Progressive (14B miles telematics data, 20+ years), Travelers (65B data points, decades) | Two insurance companies independently built AI capabilities on decades of actuarial data discipline. The regulatory requirement for actuarial rigor created clean, structured data that feeds AI models directly. This convergence between insurance and Mechanism #8 (Turn Compliance Into Deployment Advantage) is distinctive — the compliance benefit isn't governance infrastructure but DATA infrastructure. |

**Why this matters for ambidexterity:** Insurance companies don't face the data-quality problem that plagues many AI deployments. Their regulatory history solved it decades ago. This means their exploration challenge is different — not "how do we get clean data?" but "how do we extract novel insights from data we've been collecting for 20 years?" The constraint shifts from data to talent and tooling.

### Pattern 3: Business-Leader-as-AI-Chief in Finance

| Pattern | Organizations | Significance |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| Non-technologist placed atop AI function | Wells Fargo (Van Beurden, business leader), Goldman Sachs (no CAIO — CIO/CFO lead), Bank of America (no CAIO — embedded in business operations) | Three major financial institutions independently chose business-side leaders rather than technologists to drive AI strategy. This convergence with the "Business Leader as AI Chief" candidate mechanism (which also includes Coca-Cola and PwC) suggests finance may systematically prefer business-credentialed AI leadership over technical AI leadership. |

---

## Taxonomy Proposals

None. All specimens fit within the existing 9-model taxonomy. However:

- **Progressive** is a strong M6b (Contextual, Unnamed/Informal with tech-first culture) and may deserve consideration as a type specimen for M6b in insurance — an organization that IS a tech company selling insurance products, where AI is invisible infrastructure.
- **Eli Lilly's reclassification from M1 to M4** (made in prior curation) is validated by Q4 2025 earnings — the therapeutic area president structure (Dr. Carole Ho for Neuroscience, Anne White for Immunology) confirms the hub-and-spoke rather than single research lab pattern.

## Insights Updated

| Insight | New Evidence | Maturity Change |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| hub-spoke-rd-intensive | No new evidence (pharma specimens already counted). Batch confirms the pattern — all 5 pharma specimens are M3 or M4 (hub-and-spoke variants). | Stays confirmed |
| regulation-expensive-not-slow | Bank of America's rapid Erica iteration, Wells Fargo's 180K desktop deployment, UBS's 300+ AI use cases — all in heavily regulated finance. Progressive and Travelers extend to insurance. | Stays confirmed |
| caio-industry-waves | UBS CAIO (Magazzeni) already counted. No new CAIO appointments in this batch. Progressive and Bank of America are notable anti-CAIO examples in their respective sectors. | Stays confirmed |
| anti-caio-thesis | Bank of America and Progressive extend the pattern to 7 specimens. BofA achieves 90%+ employee AI adoption with no CAIO, no named AI lab. Progressive is tech-first insurer with no CAIO. Both demonstrate massive AI deployment without dedicated AI leadership. | Emerging → stays emerging (would need one more industry to promote) |
| speed-depth-trap | Wells Fargo's 30-35% automation target + $612M severance is a variant — fast deployment without addressing redeployment depth. | Hypothesis → stays hypothesis |
| ai-restructuring-convergent | Wells Fargo (-3,000 headcount via efficiency) and Moderna ($2B opex reduction with GPT tools contributing) extend the pattern. | Stays confirmed |

## New Insights Discovered

### Insight: Pharma Hub-and-Spoke Serves Exploration, Finance Hub-and-Spoke Serves Execution

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| id | pharma-hub-and-spoke-divergence |
| title | Same Structure (M4), Different Function: Pharma Hubs Explore, Finance Hubs Execute |
| theme | organizational-form |
| maturity | emerging |

**Finding:** Five pharma companies and six finance companies both adopted hub-and-spoke (M4) structures, but they serve fundamentally different organizational functions. In pharma, the hub is an AI capability center that feeds *exploration* — drug discovery, computational biology, multi-year research. In finance, the hub is a governance/deployment center that feeds *execution* — productivity tools, risk management, compliance automation. The same structural form (central hub + distributed spokes) maps to opposite poles of the ambidexterity spectrum depending on the industry's primary AI challenge.

**Evidence:**

| specimenId | note |
|------------|------|
| eli-lilly | Pharma M4: Hub = R&D capability center with 300-400 person therapeutic area hubs doing 18+ year drug discovery. Hub serves exploration. |
| pfizer | Pharma M4: Hub = CAIO + Fab Lab + Incubator. AI engineers embedded in each R&D function for drug discovery. Hub serves exploration. |
| novo-nordisk | Pharma M4: Hub = 300-person Enterprise AI team. Central capability for drug optimization + mass Copilot deployment. Mixed but R&D-oriented. |
| wells-fargo | Finance M4: Hub = business leader heading AI function. 180K desktops, 90K trained. Hub serves execution/productivity. |
| morgan-stanley | Finance M4: Hub = Firmwide AI Head coordinating 16K advisor tools. 98% adoption. Hub serves execution/deployment. |
| jpmorgan | Finance M4: Hub = ML CoE distributing LLM Suite to 250K employees. 8-week iteration. Hub serves execution/deployment. |

**Theoretical Connection:** This extends the hub-and-spoke-rd-intensive insight: the structural form (M4) is the same, but the organizational function it serves depends on where the industry's core value creation occurs. In pharma, value creation is at the research frontier (exploration), so the hub serves exploration. In finance, value creation is in operations and risk management (execution), so the hub serves execution. This is a Chandlerian insight: structure follows strategy, and strategy follows industry economics.

### Insight: Insurance Data Moat — Compliance History as AI Foundation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| id | insurance-data-moat |
| title | Insurance Regulatory History Creates Unintentional AI Data Moat |
| theme | mechanism |
| maturity | emerging |

**Finding:** Two insurance companies (Progressive and Travelers) independently built AI capabilities on decades of actuarial data discipline. Progressive's 14 billion miles of telematics data and Travelers' 65 billion clean data points were accumulated not for AI but for regulatory compliance and actuarial rigor. This regulatory history created AI-ready data foundations that competitors without decades of disciplined data collection cannot replicate. The insight extends Mechanism #8 (Turn Compliance Into Deployment Advantage) in a novel direction: the compliance advantage isn't governance infrastructure — it's DATA infrastructure accumulated over decades of regulatory requirements.

**Evidence:**

| specimenId | note |
|------------|------|
| progressive | 14B miles telematics data over 20+ years. Data foundation built for actuarial pricing, now feeds AI models. |
| travelers | 65B clean data points accumulated over decades. Data discipline driven by insurance regulatory requirements. |

**Theoretical Connection:** North's (1990) institutional economics: institutions (regulatory requirements) shape organizational capabilities over time. Insurance regulatory requirements forced disciplined data collection for decades. When AI arrived, these organizations had a data foundation that was unintentionally optimized for machine learning — clean, structured, large-scale. This is institutional path dependence creating competitive advantage: the regulatory burden of the past becomes the AI moat of the present.

## Botanist's Field Notes

The most striking finding in this batch is the pharma/finance divergence within M4 hub-and-spoke. When I started this batch, I expected the pharma specimens to look structurally similar to the finance specimens from Batch 1 — both are highly regulated, both adopt M4, both have large central AI teams. But the organizational *function* of the hub is completely different. In pharma, the hub exists to push the exploration frontier (drug discovery, computational biology, NVIDIA partnerships for protein folding). In finance, the hub exists to push execution efficiency (productivity tools, risk management, compliance automation). Same structure, opposite function. This feels like a genuinely novel observation — I haven't seen this distinction drawn in the ambidexterity literature.

The insurance pair (Progressive + Travelers) is more interesting than I expected. Progressive in particular is a provocative specimen. It's classified M6b (Contextual, Unnamed), which is unusual for a company in a highly regulated industry. Most regulated-industry specimens end up structural (M2 or M4). But Progressive's self-identity as "a tech company that sells insurance" means it treats AI as invisible infrastructure — no CAIO, no named lab, no branded AI initiative. It's the most "quiet" transformation in a regulated industry in our collection. Travelers is the opposite — TravAI is a named, branded platform with a clear CAIO-equivalent. Same industry, opposite structural response. The difference may be explained by organizational identity: Progressive has always been tech-first (it pioneered online insurance), while Travelers is a traditional insurer that adopted technology.

The NVIDIA convergence in pharma is worth watching. Three of five pharma specimens (Eli Lilly, Roche-Genentech, Pfizer) have NVIDIA partnerships specifically for computational drug discovery. This isn't a generic "we use NVIDIA GPUs" story — these are structural partnerships where NVIDIA engineers co-locate with pharma scientists. If Novo Nordisk or another pharma company announces a similar partnership, we have a confirmed pharma-specific mechanism. The organizational economics question: does the GPU provider become a new type of structural boundary-spanner in R&D-intensive industries?

I'm slightly suspicious of the Moderna specimen. The Q4 2025 earnings language is notably thin on AI structure — CEO Bancel mentions "a large number of GPTs" but provides no structural detail. The Chief People and Digital Technology Officer role is interesting (it merges HR and tech, which is rare), but we have limited evidence of what this looks like in practice. Moderna's M6a classification may be correct (enterprise-wide, contextual) but the evidence base is thinner than I'd like. The "750+ custom GPTs" number is impressive but tells us nothing about how they're governed or whether they're useful.

Novo Nordisk's CEO transition (Doustdar replacing Jorgensen in July 2025) is a live experiment in AI leadership continuity. The 300-person Enterprise AI team and CAIO position were established under Jorgensen. Will Doustdar maintain, restructure, or deprioritize? The Q4 2025 earnings conspicuously lacked AI discussion despite massive R&D spending (DKK 30B). This silence could mean AI is treated as operational infrastructure (no need to highlight it) or that the new CEO hasn't yet articulated his AI vision. Worth monitoring.

The "business leader as AI chief" pattern in finance (Wells Fargo's Van Beurden, Goldman's CIO-led approach, BofA's embedded approach) contrasts sharply with the "scientist as AI chief" pattern in pharma (UBS's academic CAIO, Pfizer's CAIO). This makes economic sense: finance needs AI to serve business operations (so business leaders lead), while pharma needs AI to serve research (so researchers lead). But it creates different structural dynamics — business-leader AI chiefs tend to favor execution-oriented M4, while researcher AI chiefs tend to favor exploration-oriented M4 or M3.

## Sector Trends

### Finance (Batch 1 + Batch 2 combined: 9 specimens)

| Metric | Finding |
|--------|---------|
| Dominant model | M4 (Hub-and-Spoke) — 5 of 9. Also M6a (Contextual) — 3 of 9. M2 (CoE) — 1. |
| Dominant orientation | Split: 5 Structural, 4 Contextual |
| CAIO status | 4 have CAIO/equivalent (UBS, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Bloomberg Head of AI). 5 do not (Goldman, Citigroup, Bank of America, Wells Fargo [business leader], Visa). |
| Key pattern | Finance is SPLIT on the CAIO question. The anti-CAIO thesis is strongest here — Goldman, Citigroup, and BofA all achieve massive deployment without one. |
| Deployment scale | Massive: ranges from 16K (Morgan Stanley) to 250K (JPMorgan) employee deployment. All 9 have enterprise-wide AI tools. |
| AI function | **Execution-oriented** — productivity, risk, compliance, client service. Not exploration/research (except Visa Research). |

### Insurance (2 specimens — first batch)

| Metric | Finding |
|--------|---------|
| Dominant model | Split: M6b (Progressive) vs. M2 (Travelers) |
| Dominant orientation | Both Contextual |
| Key pattern | Data moat from actuarial history. Both leverage decades of data discipline for AI foundation. But opposite structural responses: Progressive is quiet/vendor-dependent, Travelers is named/in-house. |
| Unique tension | Insurance faces a depth/speed tension that finance doesn't: actuarial models require deep validation (underwriting accuracy is the product), but customer-facing deployment demands speed. |

### Pharma (5 specimens — this is the definitive batch)

| Metric | Finding |
|--------|---------|
| Dominant model | M4 (Hub-and-Spoke) — 3 of 5. M3 (Embedded Teams) — 1. M6a (Contextual) — 1. |
| Dominant orientation | 4 Structural, 1 Contextual (Moderna is the outlier) |
| CAIO status | 3 have CAIO/equivalent (Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, UBS). 2 do not (Eli Lilly, Moderna). Roche has no formal CAIO but Aviv Regev serves as de facto AI leader. |
| Key pattern | Hub-and-spoke serves EXPLORATION, not execution. Hubs feed drug discovery, not productivity. This is the opposite of finance M4. |
| NVIDIA partnerships | 3 of 5 (Eli Lilly, Pfizer, Roche-Genentech) have structural NVIDIA partnerships for computational drug discovery. Convergent evolution. |
| Time horizons | Extremely long (18+ years for Eli Lilly's GLP-1 program). Pharma M4 hubs are the longest-horizon structures in the collection. |
| Moderna outlier | Only pharma specimen with contextual orientation. Treats AI as enterprise-wide tool (750+ GPTs) rather than structured research capability. May reflect biotech-vs-big-pharma distinction. |

### Cross-Sector Comparison (Finance vs. Insurance vs. Pharma)

| Dimension | Finance | Insurance | Pharma |
|-----------|---------|-----------|--------|
| Primary AI function | Execution (productivity, risk) | Execution + Exploration (underwriting optimization, novel risk models) | Exploration (drug discovery, computational biology) |
| Structural form | M4 or M6a | Split (M2 vs. M6b) | M3 or M4 |
| Hub function | Governance/deployment center | Data/governance center | R&D capability center |
| Time horizon | Short-to-medium (8-week cycles to 3-5 year views) | Medium (annual underwriting cycles) | Very long (18+ years) |
| CAIO pattern | Split — anti-CAIO thesis strong | Split (Travelers has CAIO-equivalent, Progressive doesn't) | Most have CAIO |
| Data advantage | Transaction data, client data | Actuarial data moat (decades) | Clinical/biological data |

## Key Insights for Executives

- **Same structure, different function:** Hub-and-spoke (M4) is the most common AI structure in both finance and pharma, but it serves opposite purposes. Know which function your hub serves — exploration or execution — and design governance accordingly. An exploration hub needs protection from quarterly pressure; an execution hub needs accountability metrics.
- **Your regulatory history may be your AI advantage:** Insurance companies' decades of actuarial data discipline created AI-ready data foundations that competitors can't replicate. If your industry has a long history of data regulation, your compliance burden may be an unrecognized AI asset.
- **The CAIO question is industry-specific:** Finance is genuinely split on whether a CAIO adds value. Pharma mostly has CAIOs. Insurance is split. Don't assume a CAIO is necessary — Goldman Sachs and Bank of America demonstrate that massive AI deployment is possible without one.

## Key Insights for Academics

- **Hub-and-spoke ambidexterity is bifunctional:** The same structural form (M4) can serve either exploration or execution depending on industry economics. This extends Tushman & O'Reilly's structural ambidexterity — the structure is ambidextrous not because it separates explore and exploit, but because the same structural template adapts to serve whichever function the industry demands.
- **Institutional path dependence creates AI capability:** North's (1990) institutional economics provides the theoretical frame for the insurance data moat finding. Regulatory institutions shaped organizational data practices for decades; those practices now constitute an AI capability advantage. This is unintentional capability building — the organization wasn't investing in AI when it collected 14 billion miles of telematics data.
- **The CAIO role may follow a Williamson (1975) logic:** When AI is a new, uncertain technology requiring cross-functional coordination, a dedicated coordinator (CAIO) reduces transaction costs. As AI matures into embedded infrastructure, the CAIO role adds overhead without proportional coordination value. The industry split (pharma keeps CAIOs, some finance firms don't) may reflect different positions on the AI maturity curve.

## Open Questions

- Will Novo Nordisk's new CEO (Doustdar) maintain the 300-person AI hub and CAIO position established by his predecessor?
- Is Progressive's buy-over-build AI approach sustainable at scale, or will it need to build internal AI capability as AI becomes more central to underwriting?
- Does the pharma-NVIDIA partnership pattern extend beyond our five specimens? Is NVIDIA becoming structural infrastructure for pharma R&D?
- How does Moderna's Chief People and Digital Technology Officer role work in practice? Is it a genuine structural innovation (merging HR and tech for AI change management) or a relabeling?
- Is the finance anti-CAIO thesis a temporary phenomenon (AI is still early) or a permanent structural choice (CAIO role has matured into redundancy)?
