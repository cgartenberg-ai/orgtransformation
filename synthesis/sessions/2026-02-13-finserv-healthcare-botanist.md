# Field Journal: Financial Services Natural Experiment + Healthcare Structural Discussion
**Date:** February 13, 2026 (Session 27)

## Part 1: Financial Services Natural Experiment (GS vs MS vs JPM)

### The Setup
Three firms, same industry, same regulatory environment, roughly same competitive pressure — three different structural choices. As close to a controlled comparison as field research gets.

| | Goldman Sachs | Morgan Stanley | JPMorgan |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Model** | M6a (CIO-led, no CAIO) + secondary M4 | M4 (dedicated Firmwide AI Head) | M4 + secondary M2 (dual-track) |
| **Orientation** | Contextual | Structural | Structural |
| **AI leader** | Marco Argenti (CIO, ex-Amazon VP) | Jeff McMillan (ex-WM Analytics) | Teresa Heitsenrether (CDAO, ex-Securities Svc) + Manuela Veloso (AI Research) |
| **Reports to** | CEO (implicitly) | Co-Presidents | President (Heitsenrether) + CEO-level (Veloso) |
| **Vendor strategy** | Multi-model (GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, Llama) | Single-vendor (OpenAI) | Multi-model (OpenAI + Anthropic) |

### Observation 1: All Three Chose Non-Technologist AI Leaders
Argenti is closest to a technologist (ex-Amazon) but his role is CIO, not CAIO. McMillan ran WM Analytics — a business analytics leader. Heitsenrether ran securities services for 8 years. In financial services, the AI coordination challenge is *distribution to existing workflows*, not *fundamental research*. The leader needs domain fluency, not ML expertise.

### Observation 2: Goldman's Anti-CAIO Stance Is Deliberate Design, Not Neglect
Argenti: "We don't want to create a separate AI kingdom." Goldman chose Contextual orientation because they believe AI capability should be indistinguishable from business capability. M6a-by-design, not M6a-by-neglect. Sharpest case of intentional anti-CAIO we have — stronger than CVS Health because Goldman articulates a rationale.

### Observation 3: Morgan Stanley's Single-Vendor = Williamson Asset-Specificity Choice
Deep OpenAI partnership, 98% WM adoption. Opposite of Goldman's multi-model optionality. High switching costs but enables the "flywheel." A relationship-specific capital bet.

### Observation 4: JPMorgan's Dual-Track Is Unique in Finserv
Dimon: "We took AI and data out of technology. It's too important." Separating AI as knowledge function from IT as infrastructure. Dual track (applied CDAO + academic AI Research head) mirrors pharma model. Only bank treating AI as requiring both production AND research functions.

### Purpose Claims Comparison
- **Morgan Stanley**: Almost pure commercial-success (11/16). Purpose-free rhetoric — AI justified purely on commercial terms. The 98% adoption number IS the claim.
- **Goldman Sachs**: Identity-dominant (8/16). Argenti: "We are not an AI company, but we are a company that's going to use AI to be better at what we do." Actively anti-disruption — Goldman's identity IS the product.
- **JPMorgan**: Most diverse — Dimon monopoly (12/12) ranging utopian to pragmatic to social. Audience-dependent claim ordering in action.

### Goldman Identity-Protection as Metric Resistance
Argenti: "There's a bias toward saving money you have to fight." The CIO of a Wall Street bank publicly arguing *against* cost optimization. This connects to the measurement-driven moral hazard insight — Goldman's identity framing may provide an evaluative frame that sits above metrics and constrains which measures dominate.

## Part 2: Healthcare Purpose Claims — Botanist Read

### Key Finding: Strong Mission Produces Authentically Anodyne Rhetoric
Healthcare CAIOs at academic medical centers produce identity-confirming claims ("AI helps us be who we already are") rather than identity-transforming claims. Rhetorical register is correspondingly flat. Two competing interpretations: (1) genuinely internalized mission does the authorization work, requiring low rhetorical effort; (2) formulaic institutional messaging. Both may be partially true. **Captured as insight #65: `mission-identity-anodyne-rhetoric`.**

### Healthcare Survival Claims: Demography, Not Competition
Halamka: "We have to use AI." Odeh: triple-threat (aging + cost + workforce shortage). Ross: "generational shortage." Labor deficit makes AI adoption morally obligatory — Ross: "it's a hero job." Inverts displacement anxiety. Clean moderating variable for survival claims: labor deficit vs. labor surplus changes the moral calculus.

### Ross's "Two Jobs" — Most Explicitly Ambidextrous Claim in Collection
"One is to support technology for the world's best hospital. The second is to innovate at Silicon Valley speed." Names both mandates as equally legitimate jobs, not a tradeoff.

### Governance as Positive Capability
Nadkarni: "The decision to not deploy is equally important." In healthcare, governance is framed as a core competency, not overhead. Purpose claims authorize *inaction* as well as action.

## Part 3: Identity Claims as Immune System (Hypothesis — Needs Sharpening)

**Collaborative thread:** Are leaders who lean into identity also resistant to overly leaning into hard metrics?

**Suggestive pattern:**
- Identity-dominant + metric-resistant: Goldman (Argenti fights cost bias), BMW (zero survival, no public metrics), Mayo/Mount Sinai (governance-as-capability)
- Low identity + metric-captured: Klarna (0 identity → cost capture → reversal), Salesforce (tilting commercial-success, 3 AI leaders in <3 years)

**Proposed mechanism:** Identity claims establish "who we are" criteria that sit above metrics, constraining which measures dominate. Without identity anchoring, organizations default to measurable dimensions (Holmstrom multi-task). Identity claims are relational contracts (Gibbons-Henderson) that informally communicate unmeasured dimensions.

**Complications:** JPMorgan (diverse rhetoric + aggressive metrics), Morgan Stanley (pure commercial-success but 98% adoption without disaster).

**Status:** Added as field note on `measurement-driven-moral-hazard` insight. Needs more cases and sharper mechanism before elevation to insight.
