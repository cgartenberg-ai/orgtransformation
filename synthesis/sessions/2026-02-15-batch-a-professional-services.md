## 1. Specimen-by-Specimen Analysis

### 1.1 Baker McKenzie

**Classification:** M6a (Enterprise-Wide Adoption) / Contextual / Low confidence
**Status:** Stub (single source)

Baker McKenzie's February 2026 restructuring (600--1,000 support positions cut, ~10% of global workforce) is notable for the attorney-exclusion firewall: AI displacement concentrated entirely in support functions (research, marketing, knowledge management, secretarial) while fee-earning attorneys are explicitly protected. The firm cited Anthropic's Claude Cowork by name as the restructuring catalyst -- unusual specificity.

**Proposed Tension Positions (reviewing existing):**

| Tension | Current | Proposed | Rationale |
|---------|---------|----------|-----------|
| T1 structuralVsContextual | 0.5 | 0.6 | No AI lab or CAIO. Enterprise-wide tool deployment without structural separation. Integration, not separation. |
| T2 speedVsDepth | 0.3 | 0.4 | Mass deployment (Claude Cowork across support functions) rather than careful piloting. |
| T3 centralVsDistributed | null | 0.3 | No evidence of centralized AI coordination. Distributed adoption across offices. |
| T4 namedVsQuiet | 0.8 | 0.8 | No named AI lab, no CAIO. Quiet restructuring framed as efficiency improvement. Agree with existing. |
| T5 longVsShortHorizon | 0.5 | 0.6 | Short accountability -- this is immediate cost reduction, not long-horizon research. |

**Proposed Contingencies (reviewing existing):**

| Contingency | Current | Proposed | Rationale |
|-------------|---------|----------|-----------|
| C1 regulatoryIntensity | High | High | Legal services are heavily regulated (bar associations, client confidentiality, litigation risk). |
| C2 timeToObsolescence | Medium | Medium | Law firms' core product (attorney judgment) is augmented, not replaced. Support functions are threatened. |
| C3 ceoTenure | null | Medium | Global law firm with rotating managing partners. No founder authority. |
| C4 talentMarketPosition | Talent-rich | Talent-rich | Top global law firm attracts elite legal talent. |
| C5 technicalDebt | Medium | Medium | Legacy legal tech systems, but not engineering-heavy. |
| C6 environmentalAiPull | Strong | Strong | Professional services facing existential AI pressure. Agree. |

**Mechanisms:** None currently assigned. None strongly evidenced from current data -- this is a restructuring announcement, not a structural observation. However, the attorney firewall suggests a weak form of Mechanism #1 (Protect Off-Strategy Work) applied inversely: the core product (attorney judgment) is structurally protected from AI automation. This is protection of execution, not exploration.

### 1.2 Capgemini

**Classification:** M6a (Enterprise-Wide Adoption) / Contextual / Low confidence
**Status:** Stub (single source)

EUR 700M restructuring over 2025--2026 for "country-specific workforce and skills adaptation initiatives." CEO Ezzat frames Capgemini as "the catalyst for enterprise-wide AI adoption" -- positioning the firm as enabler, not just adopter. GenAI/agentic AI already >10% of Q4 2025 bookings.

**Proposed Tension Positions (reviewing existing):**

| Tension | Current | Proposed | Rationale |
|---------|---------|----------|-----------|
| T1 structuralVsContextual | 0.3 | 0.4 | Enterprise-wide pivot, no named AI lab described. Contextual integration. |
| T2 speedVsDepth | 0.2 | 0.3 | Broad restructuring across countries rather than deep pilot-first. |
| T3 centralVsDistributed | 0.3 | 0.4 | "Country-specific" adaptation = distributed execution. No centralized AI structure described. |
| T4 namedVsQuiet | 0.5 | 0.6 | No named AI lab or CAIO in source. Enterprise-wide adoption without branding. |
| T5 longVsShortHorizon | 0.3 | 0.4 | Two-year restructuring program, but driven by immediate revenue pressure. Short-to-medium accountability. |

**Proposed Contingencies (reviewing existing):**

| Contingency | Current | Proposed | Rationale |
|-------------|---------|----------|-----------|
| C1 regulatoryIntensity | Medium | Medium | IT consulting faces moderate regulation (data privacy, client contracts). |
| C2 timeToObsolescence | Fast | Fast | Agree. IT consulting workforce model directly threatened by agentic AI. |
| C3 ceoTenure | Medium | Medium | Professional CEO, no founder dynamics. |
| C4 talentMarketPosition | Talent-constrained | Talent-constrained | Agree. Needs to reskill 340K employees. |
| C5 technicalDebt | Medium | Medium | Large legacy enterprise. |
| C6 environmentalAiPull | Strong | Strong | Existential: if clients automate with AI, they need fewer consultants. |

**Mechanisms:** None currently assigned. The EUR 700M scale is remarkable but the specimen is too thin for mechanism matching. The "catalyst" framing is a purpose claim, not a structural observation.

---

### 1.3 Forrester Research

**Classification:** M6b primary (Centralized-but-Unnamed) + M5 secondary (Product/Venture Lab) / Contextual / Low confidence
**Status:** Stub (single source)

Forrester is the most structurally radical specimen in this batch. Unlike Baker McKenzie (support staff cut, attorneys protected) or Capgemini (workforce adaptation), Forrester is cannibalizing its core product with an AI product. The AI product "Forrester AI" (formerly Izola) directly replaces human analyst research delivery. The firm exited strategy consulting entirely (bookings declined 50%+) and discontinued multi-day conferences. Research will be 80% of revenue in 2026.

**Proposed Tension Positions (reviewing existing):**

| Tension | Current | Proposed | Rationale |
|---------|---------|----------|-----------|
| T1 structuralVsContextual | 0.4 | 0.2 | The AI product (Forrester AI) suggests some structural separation (product team), but the entire org is pivoting. Closer to center than integration pole. |
| T2 speedVsDepth | 0.3 | 0.5 | Fast pivot: exiting consulting, cutting 8%, rebranding AI product. Speed over depth. |
| T3 centralVsDistributed | -0.2 | -0.2 | AI product development likely centralized. Agree. |
| T4 namedVsQuiet | 0.3 | -0.2 | Forrester AI is a named, branded product. The AI pivot is highly visible. Should be more negative (named, not quiet). |
| T5 longVsShortHorizon | 0.4 | 0.5 | Short-term accountability: consulting exit is reactive to 50%+ booking decline. |

**Proposed Contingencies (reviewing existing):**

| Contingency | Current | Proposed | Rationale |
|-------------|---------|----------|-----------|
| C1 regulatoryIntensity | Low | Low | Research/advisory is lightly regulated. |
| C2 timeToObsolescence | Fast | Fast | Core product (human research) is directly cannibalized by AI. Most threatened firm in batch. |
| C3 ceoTenure | Long | Long | George Colony, founder. Key: founder authority enables the radical self-cannibalization. |
| C4 talentMarketPosition | Talent-constrained | Talent-constrained | Mid-market firm competing for AI talent against Big Tech. |
| C5 technicalDebt | Medium | Medium | Legacy research delivery infrastructure. |
| C6 environmentalAiPull | Strong | Strong | Existential: AI directly replaces the product. |

**Mechanisms:**
- **Mechanism #10 (Productize Internal Operational Advantages):** Moderate. Forrester AI takes internal research capability and productizes it as an AI-delivered service. The firm's own analysts' knowledge becomes training data for a product that replaces them.

**Note on Forrester:** This is the clearest specimen of AI-driven self-cannibalization in the collection. The founder authority (Colony) is likely a necessary condition -- a hired CEO would face enormous career risk from cannibalizing the firm's core human expertise product. This connects to the confirmed insight "founder-authority-structural-enabler."

### 1.4 McKinsey

**Classification:** M5a (Internal Incubator) + M2 (Center of Excellence) / Contextual / Medium confidence
**Status:** Active

McKinsey is the richest specimen in this batch by far. The headline fact -- 60,000 total "employees" including 25,000 AI agents, targeting 1:1 agent-to-human parity by end of 2026 -- is structurally unprecedented. QuantumBlack (1,700 people) drives 40% of firm revenue. The 25/25 rebalancing (+25% client-facing, -25% back-office) is a deliberate workforce recomposition.

**Proposed Tension Positions (filling nulls):**

| Tension | Current | Proposed | Rationale |
|---------|---------|----------|-----------|
| T1 structuralVsContextual | null | -0.3 | QuantumBlack is structurally distinct (1,700 people, product lab) but the boundary is dissolving as AI becomes 40% of revenue. Moderate structural separation. |
| T2 speedVsDepth | null | 0.5 | Few-thousand to 25,000 agents in 18 months. Mass deployment at extreme speed. |
| T3 centralVsDistributed | null | -0.4 | QuantumBlack is a centralized capability hub. But consultants use agents in distributed engagement teams. Moderately centralized. |
| T4 namedVsQuiet | null | -0.5 | QuantumBlack is a named, branded unit. "Transform or die" is loud, not quiet. |
| T5 longVsShortHorizon | null | 0.0 | Mixed. Outcome-based partnerships suggest long horizon. But quarterly revenue attribution is strong. Center of spectrum. |

**Proposed Contingencies (reviewing existing, adding C6):**

| Contingency | Current | Proposed | Rationale |
|-------------|---------|----------|-----------|
| C1 regulatoryIntensity | Low | Low | Consulting is lightly regulated. |
| C2 timeToObsolescence | Fast | Fast | If clients can access AI analysis directly, consulting fee model collapses. |
| C3 ceoTenure | Medium | Medium | Elected managing partner, term-limited. |
| C4 talentMarketPosition | Talent-rich | Talent-rich | Top consulting talent brand globally. |
| C5 technicalDebt | Low | Low | Born-digital consulting firm with modern infrastructure. |
| C6 environmentalAiPull | (missing) | Strong | Existential: AI threatens the information asymmetry that justifies consulting fees. |

**Mechanisms (reviewing existing):**
- **Mechanism #5 (Deploy to Thousands Before You Know What Works):** Strong. Confirmed. Few thousand to 25,000 agents in 18 months is the most extreme scaling velocity in the collection.
- **Mechanism #10 (Productize Internal Operational Advantages):** Moderate. Confirmed. Outcome-based partnerships use internal AI capabilities as the basis for a new business model.
- **Mechanism #7 (Put Executives on the Tools):** Proposed (new). If consultants are using 25,000 AI agents in daily delivery, the senior partners are necessarily on the tools. The "learn by doing" model at scale.

**Structurally notable:** The decision to count AI agents as "employees" is both rhetorical and structural. If taken literally, the 1:1 target implies a hybrid organizational form where the workforce includes non-human members. This connects to the field signal "ai-agents-as-org-members." The partnership governance model (elected Managing Partner, senior partners) interacting with rapid AI transformation deserves further investigation: does the partnership model constrain or enable speed?

### 1.5 Thomson Reuters

**Classification:** M4 (Hub-and-Spoke) + M5 secondary (Product/Venture Lab) / Structural / Medium confidence
**Status:** Active

Thomson Reuters is the most structurally mature specimen in this batch and possibly the strongest professional services / knowledge work M4 in the collection. TR Labs (decades-old R&D group, now under CTO Joel Hron) serves as the central hub, providing horizontal AI platform capabilities (Open Arena, Enterprise AI Platform). Vertical product teams in Legal (CoCounsel, Westlaw), Tax (ONESOURCE+), and enterprise segments build domain-specific AI products on top.

**Proposed Tension Positions (reviewing existing):**

| Tension | Current | Proposed | Rationale |
|---------|---------|----------|-----------|
| T1 structuralVsContextual | -0.3 | -0.3 | TR Labs is structurally separate from product teams. Agree. |
| T2 speedVsDepth | 0.4 | 0.4 | 300+ AI use cases, 85% adoption, 8 acquisitions in 2 years. Speed with depth. Agree. |
| T3 centralVsDistributed | -0.2 | -0.3 | TR Labs + Enterprise AI Platform are centralized hub; product teams are distributed spokes. Slightly more centralized than current score. |
| T4 namedVsQuiet | -0.6 | -0.6 | TR Labs is a named unit. CoCounsel is branded. Agree. |
| T5 longVsShortHorizon | 0.0 | 0.0 | Mixed: TR Labs on multi-year R&D, product teams on quarterly ACV. Agree. |

**Proposed Contingencies (reviewing existing, adding C6):**

| Contingency | Current | Proposed | Rationale |
|-------------|---------|----------|-----------|
| C1 regulatoryIntensity | High | High | Legal and tax domains are heavily regulated. |
| C2 timeToObsolescence | Medium | Medium | Legal/tax information services are augmented but not immediately replaced. |
| C3 ceoTenure | Medium | Medium | Professional CEO (Hasker). |
| C4 talentMarketPosition | Talent-rich | Talent-rich | 1,000+ AI experts, 4,000+ SMEs. |
| C5 technicalDebt | Medium | Medium | Legacy content and publishing systems. |
| C6 environmentalAiPull | (missing) | Strong | AI is the growth engine: 28% of ACV from GenAI products. |

**Mechanisms (reviewing existing):**
- **#4 Consumer-Grade UX for Employee Tools:** Strong. Open Arena built in 6 weeks, 85%+ adoption, 20K+ users. Confirmed.
- **#5 Deploy to Thousands Before You Know What Works:** Strong. 300+ use cases, 85% adoption, 2K+ devs on Copilot. Confirmed.
- **#9 Hire CAIOs from Consumer Tech:** Strong. Hron's acqui-hire path (ThoughtTrace founder to CTO in 2 years). Confirmed.
- **#10 Productize Internal Operational Advantages:** Strong. Internal AI capabilities reflected in CoCounsel, Westlaw. 28% of ACV. Confirmed.

**Structurally notable:** The 4,000+ SME evaluation layer is a distinctive structural feature. Domain experts (lawyers, accountants) benchmarking AI outputs before deployment creates a quality bridge between the AI hub and domain execution. This is not engineers testing AI -- it is the firm's core human expertise being used as a quality filter for AI outputs. This may be a mechanism candidate: "Use Domain Experts as AI Quality Gates."

### 1.6 Kyndryl

**Classification:** M2 (Center of Excellence) / Structural / Medium confidence
**Status:** Active

Kyndryl organizes AI through a practice-based model: five Global Practices, with Applications, Data and AI (Michael Bradshaw) functioning as the CoE. The July 2024 leadership reshuffle (Bradshaw moved from CIO to AI practice leader) signals deliberate capability matching. The alliance-driven agent development model is distinctive: 100 agents built in 100 days with Google Cloud.

**Proposed Tension Positions (reviewing existing):**

| Tension | Current | Proposed | Rationale |
|---------|---------|----------|-----------|
| T1 structuralVsContextual | -0.4 | -0.4 | Dedicated AI practice is structurally separate. Agree. |
| T2 speedVsDepth | 0.3 | 0.3 | "100 agents in 100 days" suggests speed. Agree. |
| T3 centralVsDistributed | -0.3 | -0.3 | AI practice is centralized CoE with cross-functional governance. Agree. |
| T4 namedVsQuiet | -0.6 | -0.5 | Applications, Data and AI practice is named. AgenTeq Framework is branded. SAP CoE is named. Slightly less extreme than -0.6. |
| T5 longVsShortHorizon | 0.2 | 0.3 | Under financial pressure: stock -25%, declining revenue. Short-term accountability dominates. |

**Proposed Contingencies (reviewing existing, adding C6):**

| Contingency | Current | Proposed | Rationale |
|-------------|---------|----------|-----------|
| C1 regulatoryIntensity | Medium | Medium | Enterprise infrastructure, moderate regulation. |
| C2 timeToObsolescence | Medium | Medium | Legacy infrastructure declining, AI consulting growing. |
| C3 ceoTenure | Medium | Medium | Schroeter, former IBM CFO. |
| C4 talentMarketPosition | Talent-constrained | Talent-constrained | Competing with hyperscalers for AI talent. Headcount 90K to 60K. |
| C5 technicalDebt | High | High | IBM heritage, mainframe expertise, legacy systems. |
| C6 environmentalAiPull | (missing) | Strong | Legacy infrastructure revenue declining; AI is the only growth story. |

**Mechanisms:** None currently assigned.
- **Mechanism #5 (Deploy to Thousands Before You Know What Works):** Moderate (proposed). 100 agents in 100 days is a speed play. Bridge platform serves 1,200+ customers. But this is customer-facing delivery, not internal transformation.
- **Mechanism #4 (Consumer-Grade UX for Employee Tools):** Weak (proposed). Kyndryl Bridge as an AI-powered IT management platform, but evidence of UX-first design is thin.

**Structurally notable:** Kyndryl's alliance-driven agent development model is genuinely distinctive. Rather than building AI capabilities through internal R&D (M1/M5) or embedding AI in existing teams (M3), Kyndryl builds AI through partnerships with hyperscalers. This is a partner-mediated CoE -- neither the firm's own research nor pure vendor adoption. The IBM heritage (organizational structure, mainframe expertise, customer base) shapes the specific AI path: modernizing legacy enterprise infrastructure, not building frontier capabilities.

### 1.7 Accenture

**Classification:** M6a (Enterprise-Wide Adoption) + M5 secondary (Product/Venture Lab) / Contextual / Medium confidence
**Status:** Active

Accenture's $865M restructuring is the most financially visible AI-driven workforce transformation in the collection. 11,000 layoffs in 3 months while simultaneously hiring 77,000 AI professionals. CEO Sweet's explicit "exiting on a compressed timeline people where reskilling is not a viable path" is the most candid executive articulation of the workforce triage pattern in the collection.

**Proposed Tension Positions (reviewing existing):**

| Tension | Current | Proposed | Rationale |
|---------|---------|----------|-----------|
| T1 structuralVsContextual | 0.6 | 0.5 | Enterprise-wide adoption. Reinvention Services unit consolidation adds slight structural element. |
| T2 speedVsDepth | 0.5 | 0.6 | 550K trained in GenAI fundamentals, 70K in agentic AI. 40K ChatGPT Enterprise licenses. Maximum speed. |
| T3 centralVsDistributed | -0.2 | -0.2 | Reinvention Services as hub, but AI adoption is enterprise-wide. Agree. |
| T4 namedVsQuiet | -0.5 | -0.4 | "Reinvention Services" is named. AI Refinery is branded. But the restructuring itself is visible, not quiet. Slightly less negative. |
| T5 longVsShortHorizon | 0.4 | 0.5 | "Compressed timeline." Short-term accountability dominates. |

**Proposed Contingencies (reviewing existing, adding missing):**

| Contingency | Current | Proposed | Rationale |
|-------------|---------|----------|-----------|
| C1 regulatoryIntensity | Low | Low | Consulting and IT services, lightly regulated. |
| C2 timeToObsolescence | Fast | Fast | If clients automate with AI, they need fewer Accenture consultants. |
| C3 ceoTenure | null | Medium | Sweet is professional CEO, not founder. |
| C4 talentMarketPosition | Talent-constrained | Talent-constrained | Despite 779K employees, actively reskilling and replacing workforce. |
| C5 technicalDebt | Medium | Medium | Large legacy enterprise. |
| C6 environmentalAiPull | (missing) | Strong | Existential for the services model. |

**Mechanisms (reviewing existing):**
- **#5 Deploy to Thousands:** Strong. 550K trained, 40K ChatGPT licenses. Confirmed.
- **#6 Merge Competing AI Teams Under Single Leader:** Moderate. Reinvention Services consolidation. Confirmed.
- **#7 Put Executives on the Tools:** Moderate. 40K ChatGPT Enterprise licenses with "learn by doing" model. Confirmed.

**Structurally notable:** Sweet's "underwhelming ROI" admission while doubling down on AI hiring is valuable counter-narrative data. The explicit bifurcation of workforce into "reskillable" and "non-reskillable" is the most honest articulation of AI-driven workforce triage in the collection.

### 1.8 Salesforce

**Classification:** M5a (Internal Incubator) + M3 (Embedded Teams) / Structural / Medium confidence
**Status:** Active (High completeness)

Salesforce is the most data-rich specimen in this batch and arguably in the entire collection. The triple AI leadership structure (Inzerillo for product AI, Hysen for compliance/transformation, Thattai for Agentforce product) is remarkably well-documented. The "Customer Zero" model -- deploying Agentforce internally to restructure Salesforce's own operations, then selling the restructuring capability externally -- is a structural innovation worth codifying.

**Proposed Tension Positions (reviewing existing):**

| Tension | Current | Proposed | Rationale |
|---------|---------|----------|-----------|
| T1 structuralVsContextual | -0.5 | -0.5 | Agentforce is a structurally distinct product. Triple AI leadership. Agree. |
| T2 speedVsDepth | 0.3 | 0.4 | 380K conversations at 84% resolution. 9,500 paid deals. Speed at scale. Slightly higher. |
| T3 centralVsDistributed | -0.4 | -0.4 | Inzerillo consolidation of Agentforce + Slack. Centralized. Agree. |
| T4 namedVsQuiet | -0.7 | -0.7 | Agentforce, AgentExchange, Customer Zero -- maximally named and branded. Agree. |
| T5 longVsShortHorizon | -0.2 | -0.1 | Mixed. "One billion agents" is long-horizon vision. But quarterly earnings drive decisions. Near center. |

**Proposed Contingencies (reviewing existing):**

| Contingency | Current | Proposed | Rationale |
|-------------|---------|----------|-----------|
| C1 regulatoryIntensity | Low | Low | Enterprise software, lightly regulated. |
| C2 timeToObsolescence | Fast | Fast | If AI agents replace enterprise software workers, Salesforce's seat-based model is threatened. |
| C3 ceoTenure | Founder | Founder | Benioff. Key enabler of radical restructuring. |
| C4 talentMarketPosition | Talent-rich | Talent-rich | Top enterprise tech brand. |
| C5 technicalDebt | Medium | Medium | Legacy CRM platform being augmented. |
| C6 environmentalAiPull | (missing) | Strong | "Digital labor market" framing. AI is the product and the restructuring tool. |

**Mechanisms (reviewing existing):**
- **#5 Deploy to Thousands:** Strong. 380K conversations, 84% resolution, 9,500 paid deals. Confirmed.
- **#9 Hire CAIOs from Consumer Tech:** Moderate. Hysen (Google/DHS to Salesforce). Confirmed.
- **#10 Productize Internal Operational Advantages:** Strong. Strongest evidence in the collection. Internal restructuring capability (support staff 9K to 5K) becomes the external sales pitch via AgentExchange. Confirmed.

**Additional mechanism proposal:**
- **Mechanism #7 (Put Executives on the Tools):** The Customer Zero model means Inzerillo (President) is personally deploying and evaluating Agentforce before commercial release. This is executives on the tools at the structural level -- the President's primary job is to use the product internally.

**Structurally notable:** The AI leadership succession (Shih as CEO of Salesforce AI, ~20 months --> Evans as EVP/GM, ~15 months --> Thattai as EVP/GM, current) with progressively narrowing scope is a structural signal worth codifying. Three leaders in under three years, each with a more operational and less strategic mandate. This is the exploration-to-execution leadership transition: visionaries are replaced by operators as the product matures.

## 2. Summary Table: Proposed Scores

### Tension Positions

| Specimen | T1 (struct/ctx) | T2 (speed/depth) | T3 (cent/dist) | T4 (named/quiet) | T5 (long/short) |
|----------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| baker-mckenzie | 0.6 | 0.4 | 0.3 | 0.8 | 0.6 |
| capgemini | 0.4 | 0.3 | 0.4 | 0.6 | 0.4 |
| forrester | 0.2 | 0.5 | -0.2 | -0.2 | 0.5 |
| mckinsey | **-0.3** | **0.5** | **-0.4** | **-0.5** | **0.0** |
| thomson-reuters | -0.3 | 0.4 | -0.3 | -0.6 | 0.0 |
| kyndryl | -0.4 | 0.3 | -0.3 | -0.5 | 0.3 |
| accenture-openai | 0.5 | 0.6 | -0.2 | -0.4 | 0.5 |
| salesforce | -0.5 | 0.4 | -0.4 | -0.7 | -0.1 |

Bold = newly proposed (was null). All others are minor revisions or confirmations.

**Pattern in T1:** The batch splits cleanly. Baker McKenzie, Capgemini, and Accenture cluster on the contextual/integration side (0.4-0.6) -- enterprise-wide adoption without structural AI units. Forrester sits near center (0.2). McKinsey, Thomson Reuters, Kyndryl, and Salesforce sit on the structural/separation side (-0.3 to -0.5) -- all have named AI units or product teams. The dividing line is whether the firm has built a distinct AI capability (product, lab, or CoE) vs. simply deploying AI tools across the existing workforce.

**Pattern in T4:** The batch also splits on named/quiet. The three stubs (Baker McKenzie, Capgemini, Forrester without the AI product) are quieter transformations -- announcements about restructuring, not about AI capability branding. The richer specimens (McKinsey, Thomson Reuters, Kyndryl, Salesforce) all have named AI brands (QuantumBlack, CoCounsel, AgenTeq, Agentforce). Observation: naming follows investment. Once you spend hundreds of millions or billions on AI capability, you brand it.

### Contingency Levels

| Specimen | C1 reg | C2 obsol | C3 ceo | C4 talent | C5 debt | C6 pull |
|----------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| baker-mckenzie | High | Med | Med | Rich | Med | Strong |
| capgemini | Med | Fast | Med | Constrained | Med | Strong |
| forrester | Low | Fast | Long/Founder | Constrained | Med | Strong |
| mckinsey | Low | Fast | Med | Rich | Low | Strong |
| thomson-reuters | High | Med | Med | Rich | Med | Strong |
| kyndryl | Med | Med | Med | Constrained | High | Strong |
| accenture-openai | Low | Fast | Med | Constrained | Med | Strong |
| salesforce | Low | Fast | Founder | Rich | Med | Strong |

**Pattern in C6:** Every specimen in this batch has Strong environmental AI pull. This is not a coincidence -- professional services and knowledge work firms face existential AI pressure because their core product IS human expertise, which AI directly threatens or augments.

**Pattern in C2 x C4:** The most structurally radical transformations (Forrester, McKinsey, Accenture, Salesforce) all have Fast time-to-obsolescence. But they split on talent: Forrester and Accenture are talent-constrained and respond with aggressive workforce replacement. McKinsey and Salesforce are talent-rich and respond with workforce recomposition (cut some roles, hire others). Hypothesis: talent market position moderates the relationship between obsolescence pressure and restructuring strategy.

### Mechanism Matches

| Specimen | M1 | M2 | M3 | M4 | M5 | M6 | M7 | M8 | M9 | M10 |
|----------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|

| accenture-openai | | | | | S | M | M | | | |
| salesforce | | | | | S | | M | | M | S |

S = Strong, M = Moderate. New proposals in bold context above.

Thomson Reuters demonstrates 4 mechanisms (the most in this batch). Salesforce demonstrates 4. McKinsey 3. Accenture 3. The three stubs (Baker McKenzie, Capgemini, Forrester) have 0-1 mechanisms -- insufficient structural data for mechanism matching. This is expected: mechanisms require organizational observation, not just restructuring announcements.

## 3. Cross-Cutting Analysis

### 3.1 The Professional Services Paradox: Selling What You're Surviving

The most striking pattern in this batch is what the collection has already tagged as the "consulting-dual-identity" insight, but which now demands a sharper formulation. Every specimen in this batch is simultaneously (a) transforming its own organization with AI and (b) selling AI transformation as a product or service. This is not a simple "practice what you preach" situation. It is a recursive economic problem.

Consider the information economics. A consulting firm's core asset is human expertise -- specifically, the information asymmetry between the firm's experts and the client. AI collapses that asymmetry. If Capgemini's clients can deploy agentic AI to solve problems that previously required Capgemini consultants, Capgemini's value proposition erodes. Capgemini's response is to restructure its workforce (EUR 700M) to become the "catalyst for enterprise-wide AI adoption" -- selling the capability that threatens its own business model. This is Christensen's innovator's dilemma applied to professional services: the firm must sell the technology that cannibalizes its own revenue, because the alternative (not selling it) means a competitor will.

The economic logic creates a testable prediction: professional services firms will be structurally biased toward AI adoption approaches that preserve their intermediary role. McKinsey's shift to "outcome-based partnerships" is precisely this -- moving from selling recommendations (information asymmetry) to co-investing in client outcomes (execution asymmetry). Thomson Reuters' CoCounsel doesn't replace lawyers; it gives lawyers better tools (preserving the lawyer's intermediary role). But Forrester's AI product directly replaces human analyst delivery, cannibalizing its own intermediary role -- the most radical response, and notably enabled by founder authority (Colony).

### 3.2 The Firewall Gradient: Where Does AI Stop and Human Expertise Begin?

This batch reveals a gradient of how firms draw the line between AI-automatable work and protected human expertise:

1. **Baker McKenzie (hardest firewall):** Attorneys completely protected. Support staff completely exposed. Binary division by role type.
2. **Thomson Reuters (quality-gated firewall):** 4,000+ domain experts evaluate AI outputs before deployment. AI does the work; humans verify it. The firewall is a quality checkpoint, not a role boundary.
3. **McKinsey (dissolving firewall):** 25,000 AI agents working alongside 40,000 humans. The boundary between human and agent work is blurring toward 1:1 parity. No explicit firewall.
4. **Salesforce (inverted firewall):** AI handles 84% of support conversations autonomously. Humans handle the 2% escalations. The firewall has flipped -- humans are the exception handler, not the default worker.
5. **Forrester (no firewall):** AI product directly replaces human analyst research delivery. The core product IS automated. No human expertise firewall at all.

This gradient correlates with two variables: (a) how threatened the core product is by AI (Baker McKenzie low, Forrester high) and (b) whether the firm can monetize the AI capability separately (Thomson Reuters yes via CoCounsel, Baker McKenzie no).

From an organizational economics perspective, the firewall position reflects the firm's assessment of where human judgment creates the most economic value. Baker McKenzie's firewall says: "Attorney judgment is where we extract rents; everything else is overhead." Salesforce's inverted firewall says: "AI resolution at 84% accuracy is sufficient for most interactions; human judgment is a minority escalation path." Forrester says: "The research itself can be automated; the brand and distribution channel are the remaining human assets."

### 3.3 The Speed Consensus and the Depth Deficit

All eight specimens lean toward speed over depth on T2 (range: 0.3 to 0.6, mean: 0.42). Not a single specimen in this batch favors deep piloting over wide deployment. This is structurally distinctive compared to pharma specimens (which favor depth) or financial services (which favor compliance-gated depth).

The speed consensus likely reflects the economic pressure specific to knowledge work: when the production function changes (AI replaces information aggregation), the cost of waiting is measured in lost competitive position. McKinsey's scaling from "a few thousand agents" to 25,000 in 18 months, Accenture's 550,000-person GenAI training, Thomson Reuters' 85% platform adoption -- these are speed plays driven by first-mover logic in markets where the product is expertise.

But the collection already contains a cautionary tale: Klarna's speed-without-depth trap (insight "speed-depth-trap"). None of these eight specimens have yet reported quality reversals. The question is whether the professional services context creates stronger quality feedback loops (clients complain immediately when advice quality drops) or weaker ones (AI-generated research may be "good enough" without anyone noticing degradation). Salesforce's 84% resolution rate and 2% escalation rate suggest the feedback loop works for transactional support. Whether it works for complex advisory (McKinsey, Capgemini) is untested and arguably untestable from public data.

### 3.4 The Alliance Model: Kyndryl as Structural Outlier

Kyndryl's alliance-driven agent development model deserves separate attention because it represents a genuinely different structural approach to AI capability. Where McKinsey builds AI internally (QuantumBlack), Thomson Reuters acquires AI startups (8 acquisitions in 2 years), and Salesforce builds AI products (Agentforce), Kyndryl builds AI capabilities through partnerships with hyperscalers (Google Cloud, Microsoft, NVIDIA, SAP).

This is a make-vs-buy decision with implications for organizational boundaries. Coase's theory of the firm predicts that activities will be organized inside the firm when transaction costs of market-based contracting exceed the costs of internal organization. Kyndryl's alliance model suggests the opposite calculus: the transaction costs of hyperscaler partnerships are lower than the internal costs of building AI R&D from scratch, especially for a firm with 60,000 employees, declining revenue, and IBM heritage technical debt.

The hypothesis: firms with high technical debt (C5: High) and constrained talent markets (C4: Talent-constrained) will default to alliance-driven AI capability rather than internal R&D. Kyndryl is the clearest case, but Capgemini's "country-specific workforce adaptation" may also reflect a partner-mediated approach. This is worth tracking as a potential new mechanism: "Build AI Capability Through Strategic Alliances Rather Than Internal R&D."

### 3.5 Workforce Recomposition, Not Just Reduction

The simple narrative -- "AI replaces workers" -- does not match the structural reality in this batch. What we observe is workforce recomposition: simultaneous cuts and hires with different skill profiles.

- **Accenture:** 11K layoffs + 77K AI hires. Net positive headcount change.
- **Salesforce:** 4,000 support cuts + 20%+ more AEs hired. Redeployment from support to sales.
- **McKinsey:** 25% back-office reduction + 25% client-facing increase. Zero net change.
- **Baker McKenzie:** 600-1,000 support cuts. No reported new hiring. Net reduction.
- **Forrester:** 8% cut + consulting exit. No reported new hiring. Net reduction.

The pattern: larger firms (Accenture, Salesforce, McKinsey) recompose their workforces -- cutting roles where AI replaces human information processing and hiring roles where human judgment or relationships remain valuable (client-facing, sales). Smaller firms (Baker McKenzie, Forrester) simply cut. The economic logic is straightforward: larger firms have the scale to absorb redeployment costs and the market position to attract AI talent. Smaller firms lack both.

This connects to the confirmed insight "ai-restructuring-convergent" but adds a moderating variable: firm size determines whether AI-driven restructuring manifests as recomposition (large firms) or reduction (small/mid firms). This is worth testing against the broader collection.

### 3.6 The Customer Zero Innovation

Salesforce's "Customer Zero" model deserves codification as a potential new insight. The structure: one executive (Inzerillo) owns both internal deployment of Agentforce and external product commercialization. Internal deployment generates metrics (84% resolution rate, 2% escalation, $1.5M pipeline from sales agent) that become the external sales pitch.

This is Mechanism #10 (Productize Internal Operational Advantages) elevated to an organizational design principle. The structural innovation is collapsing the boundary between internal IT function and external product function into a single role. This creates a tight feedback loop: internal deployment reveals product limitations (leading to Agentforce recalibration with "Agent Script" deterministic controls), and product improvements immediately deploy internally.

The economic logic is about credibility signaling. In a market where AI vendor claims are abundant and unverified, Salesforce can say "we use this ourselves and here are the metrics." The Customer Zero model is an institutional commitment device -- by tying the President's performance to internal deployment metrics, the firm cannot hide behind vaporware.

McKinsey's "25,000 AI agents" may be a similar credibility signal: the firm's internal transformation becomes the credential for client AI transformation work. The difference is that McKinsey's internal transformation is not directly productized (no "McKinsey Agent" for sale), while Salesforce's is.

## 4. Proposed New Insights

### 4.1 Professional Services Firewall Gradient (New -- Emerging)

**Title:** Professional Services Firms Draw AI Firewalls at the Point of Maximum Rent Extraction

**Finding:** Professional services firms in the collection create explicit or implicit boundaries between AI-automatable work and protected human expertise. The firewall position correlates with where the firm extracts economic rents: Baker McKenzie protects attorneys (billable hours), Thomson Reuters gates AI with domain experts (quality assurance), McKinsey blurs the boundary (moving to outcome-based pricing). The gradient runs from hardest firewalls in regulated high-rent-extraction roles (law) to no firewall where the product itself is being automated (research advisory).

**Evidence:** baker-mckenzie (attorney firewall), thomson-reuters (4K SME evaluation layer), mckinsey (dissolving boundary, 1:1 target), salesforce (inverted -- AI default, human exception), forrester (no firewall -- product automated).

**Theoretical connection:** Barzel (1997) on property rights and rent extraction: the firm draws the AI boundary at the point where human judgment is hardest to replicate and generates the highest rents. The firewall protects the firm's rent-extracting assets.

### 4.2 Explorer-to-Operator Leadership Succession (New -- Emerging)

**Title:** AI Product Leadership Follows an Explorer-to-Operator Succession Pattern

**Finding:** Salesforce cycled through three AI leaders in under three years with progressively narrowing scope: Clara Shih (CEO of Salesforce AI, visionary scope) to Adam Evans (EVP/GM, builder scope) to Madhav Thattai (EVP/GM Agentforce, operator scope). Each transition narrowed the mandate from strategic AI leadership to operational product management. This mirrors the exploration-to-execution transition predicted by ambidexterity theory: visionaries are replaced by operators as the product matures.

**Evidence:** salesforce (three AI leaders in <3 years with narrowing scope). Possible parallel: thomson-reuters (Hron elevated from startup CTO through three roles, but this is an inverse trajectory -- operator elevated to visionary).

**Theoretical connection:** Henderson and Clark's architectural innovation: the organizational challenge shifts from invention to integration as the technology matures. The leadership profile must shift accordingly. Holmstrom's contract theory adds: visionary leaders tolerate ambiguity (incomplete contracts); operators require clearly specified deliverables (complete contracts).

### 4.3 Alliance-Mediated AI Capability (New -- Hypothesis)

**Title:** Firms with High Technical Debt Default to Alliance-Mediated AI Capability

**Finding:** Kyndryl builds AI capabilities through hyperscaler partnerships (100 agents in 100 days with Google Cloud) rather than internal R&D, internal product development, or acquisition. The hypothesis: firms with high technical debt (C5: High) and constrained talent markets (C4: Talent-constrained) will default to alliance-mediated AI capability because the transaction costs of partnerships are lower than the internal costs of building from scratch.

**Evidence:** kyndryl (alliance-driven agent development with Google Cloud, Microsoft, NVIDIA, SAP). Possible support: capgemini (country-specific adaptation may be partner-mediated).

**Theoretical connection:** Coase (1937) on the boundary of the firm: alliance-mediated capability development occurs when the internal costs of building AI R&D exceed the transaction costs of hyperscaler partnerships. Williamson's (1975) asset specificity adds nuance: generic AI capabilities (LLM integration, agent frameworks) can be obtained through alliances; firm-specific AI capabilities (proprietary data, domain models) must be built internally.

## 5. Evidence for Existing Insights

| Existing Insight | New Evidence from This Batch |
|------------------|------------------------------|
| services-business-model-crisis | Baker McKenzie, Capgemini, Forrester, Kyndryl all restructuring workforce economics, not just deploying tools. Extends the IT services finding to law firms and research firms. |
| consulting-dual-identity | McKinsey, Accenture, Capgemini, Kyndryl all sell AI transformation while transforming themselves. Capgemini's "catalyst" framing is the clearest case of self-referential positioning. |
| ai-restructuring-convergent | Baker McKenzie (600-1K), Capgemini (EUR 700M), Forrester (8%), Accenture ($865M), Salesforce (4K+1K) all in Feb 2026 timeframe. Professional services wave adds to the convergence evidence. |
| management-delayering-convergent | McKinsey (-25% back-office), Accenture (Reinvention Services consolidation). Adds professional services to the delayering evidence. |
| founder-authority-structural-enabler | Forrester (Colony enables radical self-cannibalization), Salesforce (Benioff enables "I need less heads"). Two founder-led firms taking the most radical structural actions. |
| entry-level-talent-hollow | Accenture ("exiting non-reskillable"), Salesforce (engineering hiring frozen). Support for the talent pipeline concern. |
| speed-depth-trap | No reversals observed in this batch yet. But the speed consensus (T2 mean: 0.42) suggests this batch is at risk. |

## 6. Questions for Next Batch

1. **Does the firewall gradient hold outside professional services?** Pharma firms (Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk) protect R&D scientists. Finance firms (JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs) protect relationship managers. Is this the same economic logic (protect rent-extracting assets) or different?

2. **Is the alliance-mediated capability model confined to high-debt firms?** Kyndryl is the clearest case, but do other high-debt specimens (e.g., legacy automakers, traditional retailers) also default to partnership over internal R&D?

3. **Does the explorer-to-operator succession pattern appear outside Salesforce?** Thomson Reuters' Hron trajectory (operator elevated to visionary) is the inverse. Google's Hassabis (visionary retained through mergers) is different again. Is the Salesforce pattern an anomaly or a general rule?

4. **How do non-services firms with Fast C2 (time-to-obsolescence) handle the self-cannibalization problem?** Services firms can theoretically pivot to selling AI transformation. What about firms whose core product is directly replaced by AI with no "sell the replacement" option?

5. **Is the Feb 2026 professional services restructuring wave independent rational response or imitation?** Baker McKenzie, Capgemini, and Forrester all announced within days of each other (Feb 13, 2026). The timing is suspicious for independent response. Industry conference season, earnings reporting cycles, or genuine coordination?
