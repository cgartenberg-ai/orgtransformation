The driver is specialization and local knowledge: the hub coordinates shared AI infrastructure, while the spokes preserve deep domain expertise in therapeutic areas that cannot be centralized without information loss. Regulation may co-occur in these industries but is not the mechanism — the structural logic is about matching problems to distributed specialized knowledge. Note: all five specimens are pharma; confirming this as an R&D-intensity pattern (vs. a regulation pattern) requires non-pharma R&D-intensive specimens (e.g., semiconductor, aerospace).",

AI expands individual cognitive capacity, reducing demand for information-relay roles (middle management, junior analysts). The convergence across unrelated industries is consistent with independent rational responses to the same technological shock — but the tight timing and similar framing also leave room for imitation. The 'redundancy washing' counter-explanation (cuts that would have happened anyway, now dressed in AI language) cannot be ruled out with current evidence.",

      "finding": "Three organizations across different industries are cutting entry-level roles while AI proficiency among younger workers is at an all-time high. Accenture's explicit 'exiting non-reskillable' language is the most honest articulation: some roles won't be retrained — they'll be eliminated. This creates a structural talent pipeline problem: organizations are eliminating the roles that develop future senior talent. The emerging 'AI Reliability Engineer' role represents a new entry point, but it's unclear whether this compensates for the breadth of traditional entry-level elimination.",
