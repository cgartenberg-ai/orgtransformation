      "finding": "Five pharmaceutical companies independently adopted Model 4 (Hub-and-Spoke) with central AI teams feeding into distributed therapeutic area teams. The driver is specialization and local knowledge: the hub coordinates shared AI infrastructure, while the spokes preserve deep domain expertise in therapeutic areas that cannot be centralized without information loss. Regulation may co-occur in these industries but is not the mechanism — the structural logic is about matching problems to distributed specialized knowledge. Note: all five specimens are pharma; confirming this as an R&D-intensity pattern (vs. a regulation pattern) requires non-pharma R&D-intensive specimens (e.g., semiconductor, aerospace).",

      "finding": "A multi-level framework predicts both the structural model chosen for AI work and the speed of AI adoption: (1) Technical architecture modularity (Conway/Colfer & Baldwin mirroring hypothesis) predicts the structural model — modular, software-first architectures mirror into flat, contextual AI structures (M6a/M9), while integral, legacy-laden architectures mirror into governed hub-and-spoke structures (M4) or embedded teams (M3). (2) Tacit knowledge intensity at inter-component interfaces (Garicano/Henderson & Clark) predicts adoption speed — the bottleneck is not AI maturity but the cost of modularizing tacit knowledge. (3) CEO provenance and conviction moderates both — a CEO whose mental model assumes modularity and democratized tooling (e.g., tech-sector background) can push toward M6a even in integral-leaning industries, while a skeptical CEO can slow deployment within any structural model. Mirroring operates on two levels simultaneously: the technical architecture of the product, and the cognitive model the CEO brings about how work should be organized. When both are congruent, adoption is fast and structural choices are clean. When incongruent, friction emerges.",

Dimension 2: tacit information within modules — knowledge needed to perform the core value-creating work inside a unit, predicting the depth of AI capability penetration and whether AI can operate on the full problem or only a partial representation. When within-module information is computationally complete (Moderna mRNA sequences, Netflix viewing data, financial transactions), AI operates on the full problem. When critical information is generated by physical processes or embedded in human judgment (Lilly assays, Disney creative judgment, automotive manufacturing tolerances), AI operates on an incomplete representation.

Apple has no equivalent of Google DeepMind, Amazon's AGI lab, or Meta's MSL. When Apple restructured AI, the result was a deliberately weak hub (VP-level Subramanya under Federighi, not SVP-level direct-to-CEO) — the thinnest coordination layer in any M4 we've documented. The hypothesis: tightly-coupled organizations (functional structures with single P&L, strong lateral integration) cannot modularize exploration activities into structurally independent units without disrupting the coupling that makes them effective. They default to contextual integration (M5/M6 patterns) or weak-hub M4 variants. Conversely, these same organizations may be faster at embedding AI across existing functions precisely because the resource fluidity and lateral coordination of the functional model facilitates diffusion. Apple's quiet, long-running AI integration ('it's at the root of the Watch' — Cook) is consistent: strong at contextual integration, weak at structural exploration separation.

      "finding": "When CEOs deploy survival-type purpose claims ('adapt or die,' 'no Plan B,' 'half of all white-collar workers'), they are not merely signaling structural inadequacy — they are *substituting* rhetoric for structure. Survival rhetoric does the organizational work that a structural response would do: it creates urgency, authorizes resource reallocation, and justifies disruption to existing routines. The key insight is that purpose and structure are complementary means of organizational transformation, and when one is absent, the other must carry more weight. \n\nFord is the clearest case: Farley leads with survival rhetoric (5 of 12 claims) and has the weakest dedicated AI exploration structure among automotive peers. Latitude AI exists but Farley's public narrative is almost entirely about workforce displacement, not product AI. The survival rhetoric is doing the work that a Neue Klasse-style structural commitment would do if Ford had one. \n\nCompare BMW: zero survival claims, but BMW has the Neue Klasse platform with 20x computing power and a permanent organizational design commitment ('we will never again separate hardware from software'). BMW's structural solution carries the transformation load; Zipse's rhetoric can focus on identity rather than urgency. \n\nHoneywell shows a third pattern: Kapur uses survival rhetoric but directs it *outward* at customers ('there is no Plan B' for labor shortages), not inward at Honeywell. This is consistent with Honeywell already having an internal structural solution (AI Ambassadors, six-chapter framework). When structure handles internal transformation, survival rhetoric can be redirected as a sales tool. \n\nThe hypothesis upgraded: survival rhetoric is not merely *correlated* with structural absence — it is a *functional substitute*. Organizations allocate their transformation effort across two channels: structural (org design, resource allocation, decision rights) and rhetorical (purpose claims, urgency narratives, identity assertions). When one channel is weak, the other must compensate. This predicts that survival rhetoric should *decrease* as structural solutions are built, not merely be absent from the start.",

      "finding": "In M4 hub-and-spoke organizations, the division of purpose rhetoric between leaders mirrors the structural division between exploration and execution — not because rhetoric reveals structure (a diagnostic claim), but because the two are co-produced responses to the same organizational challenge. Structure allocates decision rights; purpose rhetoric allocates meaning-making rights. Together they constitute the organization's response to the AI transformation challenge. \n\nToyota is the sharpest case: Gill Pratt (exploration/TRI) speaks exclusively in teleological and higher-calling terms ('amplify not replace,' 'moral obligation,' 'autonomy of people'), while Brian Kursar (execution/Enterprise AI) speaks exclusively in commercial-success terms ('20% productivity,' 'bridge research and production'). Neither crosses into the other's register. This is not Pratt 'signaling' his structural role — it's Pratt's purpose rhetoric and his structural mandate jointly constituting what TRI means inside Toyota. \n\nHoneywell shows a three-way complementarity: Kapur (CEO) handles utopian, survival, teleological, and higher-calling claims; Sheila Jordan (CDTO) handles only commercial-success claims ('flywheel,' 'early wins'); Venkatarayalu (CTO) handles framework claims. Each leader's rhetorical register and structural mandate are two aspects of the same organizational design choice. \n\nFord shows the pathological case: Farley monopolizes ALL purpose rhetoric; Doug Field (CTO/Latitude AI) is virtually silent — one press release quote in three years. The structural separation exists (Latitude AI is a subsidiary), but the complementary rhetorical separation doesn't. Farley hasn't delegated meaning-making to his exploration leader. This predicts coordination problems: the exploration unit has decision rights but not meaning-making authority. \n\nBMW is the counter-case: Zipse monopolizes all rhetoric because BMW's functional org doesn't structurally separate exploration from execution — there is no exploration leader to have a separate rhetorical register. The rhetorical concentration is complementary to the structural concentration. \n\nThe key theoretical claim: organizations that achieve complementarity between structural design and purpose rhetoric — where decision rights and meaning-making rights are coherently allocated — should outperform those where the two are misaligned. Ford (structural separation + rhetorical monopoly) is the predicted failure case. Toyota (structural separation + rhetorical separation) is the predicted success case.",

Structural separation of exploration and execution is more effective when accompanied by complementary rhetorical separation — where exploration leaders make meaning-claims (teleological, higher-calling) and execution leaders make performance-claims (commercial-success, metrics). The co-production framing also connects to Gibbons & Henderson (2012) relational contracts: the rhetorical register a leader adopts is a form of implicit contract with their organizational constituency. And to March (1991): the language of exploration (possibility, purpose, horizon) is structurally different from the language of exploitation (efficiency, metrics, speed). What's new is treating purpose rhetoric not as a signal of structure, but as a co-equal design choice that must be coherent with structure to be effective.",

      "finding": "The four industrial/automotive specimens scanned in this batch (Ford, BMW, Honeywell, Toyota) share a striking pattern: zero utopian claims across all 53 claims. Not one industrial CEO invokes civilizational transformation, new eras for humanity, or epochal change. This is a categorical absence, not a distributional shift — industrial CEOs simply do not use the utopian register that dominates tech CEO discourse (Zuckerberg, Altman, Huang). Instead, industrial CEOs cluster around three registers: survival (Ford), identity (BMW), and commercial-success + teleological (Honeywell, Toyota). BMW's profile is the most distinctive: pure identity rhetoric (6/12 claims) with zero survival despite operating in an industry widely described as facing existential disruption. Zipse refuses the adapt-or-die frame entirely, instead asserting 'BMW IS the Neue Klasse' — collapsing product platform and organizational identity into one. This is anti-survival rhetoric: BMW is not threatened, it is choosing. Toyota's profile reveals a different pattern: Pratt's 'amplify not replace' philosophy functions as a pre-existing research identity that was deployed as purpose rhetoric when AI became strategically important. The philosophy predates the AI era — it comes from Toyota's manufacturing heritage (Toyota Production System's respect for human judgment). This suggests that some organizations don't create new purpose narratives for AI; they activate existing identity elements. Cross-sector comparison: tech CEOs use purpose claims to authorize building something new (utopian); industrial CEOs use purpose claims to authorize preserving something existing (identity/survival) or to solve concrete problems (teleological/commercial-success). The rhetorical work is fundamentally different even when the structural models are similar (both sectors converge on M4).\n\nCritically, this is not just about rhetoric — the institutional constraints that limit rhetorical registers also limit structural choices. Physical production constraints (unions, supply chains, safety regulation) both prevent utopian rhetoric AND prevent aggressive structural experimentation (M8 skunkworks, rapid pivots). The rhetorical constraints and structural constraints are two expressions of the same institutional boundary conditions. This means purpose-structure complementarity (see rhetorical-division-mirrors-structure) operates differently in industrial vs. tech sectors — not because complementarity doesn't hold, but because the feasible set of complementary pairs is narrower. Industrial firms can't pair utopian rhetoric with M8 skunkworks the way tech firms can. Their complementary pairs are necessarily more conservative: identity rhetoric + embedded AI (BMW), teleological rhetoric + M4 hub (Toyota), survival rhetoric + workforce restructuring (Ford). Batch 11 adds four non-automotive industries: legal tech (commercial-dominant), agriculture (balanced with higher-calling), healthcare insurance (defensive identity, zero utopian — but possibly crisis-shaped), airlines (identity-dominant, zero teleological). Confirms utopian claims remain rare outside tech; disconfirms prediction that no industrial CEO will use higher-calling on earnings calls (Deere's May uses 'higher purpose' on Q4 2024 call).",

In the AI era, the problem has inverted: CEOs who have internalized Grove and Christensen are pushing AI transformation top-down faster than their organizations, customers, and products can absorb it. The chaos comes from the opposite direction — headquarters manufacturing urgency faster than the market requires. This may be a specifically 2020s phenomenon because Grove's book became a Silicon Valley bible, causing leaders to overcorrect from 'too slow' to 'too fast.'\n\nThe Inverse Grove has a distinctive *rhetorical signature* visible in purpose claims data. Leaders experiencing inverse Grove tend toward utopian and identity claims (authorizing the future they're building), while their organizations' front-line reality creates survival and commercial-success counter-narratives from middle management and technical leaders. The rhetorical gap between CEO claims and operational-leader claims may be a measurable proxy for the degree of inverse Grove. Salesforce is the sharpest case: Benioff's 'digital labor revolution' rhetoric (utopian) vs. the Agentforce team's deterministic Agent Script recalibration (commercial-success reality). BMW: Zipse's pure identity rhetoric (choosing, not threatened) vs. the implicit factory-floor reality of Neue Klasse integration. When the rhetorical distance between CEO and operational leaders is large, the organization is likely in inverse Grove territory.\n\nThe causal mechanism behind inverse-Grove may be measurement-driven moral hazard (see measurement-inverse-grove-connection): AI transition metrics systematically overstate success, causing bounded-rational escalation.

      "theme": "purpose-claims",
      "maturity": "emerging",
      "finding": "The central finding from 1,082 purpose claims across 51 specimens: purpose rhetoric and organizational structure are not independent channels of organizational response to AI transformation — they are complementary practices in the Milgrom & Roberts (1990, 1995) sense. Organizations that achieve coherence between their structural choices (what model, what decision rights, what resource allocation) and their purpose rhetoric (what leaders say about why AI matters and what it means for the organization) appear to execute more effectively than organizations where structure and rhetoric are misaligned.\n\nThe complementarity operates through several mechanisms:\n\n1. **Rhetorical division of labor mirrors structural division.** When organizations structurally separate exploration from execution (M4 hub-and-spoke), the most effective ones also separate *meaning-making*: exploration leaders use teleological/higher-calling rhetoric, execution leaders use commercial-success rhetoric. Toyota and Honeywell demonstrate this. Ford is the predicted failure case: structural separation (Latitude AI) without rhetorical delegation (Farley monopolizes all purpose claims).\n\n2. **Survival rhetoric substitutes for structural response.** When organizations lack a structural solution (no dedicated AI exploration unit, no resource commitment), survival rhetoric fills the gap — creating urgency and authorizing change rhetorically rather than structurally. Ford (heaviest survival, weakest structure) vs. BMW (zero survival, strongest structural commitment). The substitution works less well because rhetoric and structure are super-modular: doing both exceeds the sum of doing each alone.\n\n3. **Sector institutions constrain both simultaneously.** The same institutional forces (physical production, unions, regulation) that limit structural choices (no M8 skunkworks in automotive) also limit rhetorical choices (no utopian claims from industrial CEOs). This narrows the feasible set of complementary purpose-structure pairs by sector.\n\n4. **Rhetorical distance signals structural misalignment.** When the CEO's purpose claims are far from operational leaders' claims (Salesforce: utopian CEO vs. pragmatic product team), the organization is likely in 'inverse Grove' territory — headquarters outrunning front lines. The rhetorical gap is a measurable proxy for structural misalignment.\n\n5. **Counter-positioning extends to rhetoric.** The AI-as-infrastructure vs. AI-as-actor counter-positioning is simultaneously a structural choice (embedded vs. named units) and a rhetorical choice (quiet identity vs. visible transformation). SAP/BMW (infrastructure + identity rhetoric) vs. Salesforce/Tesla (actor + utopian rhetoric).\n\nThis reframes the purpose claims track from 'how leaders communicate about AI' to 'how organizations construct coherent transformation responses across multiple channels.' Purpose rhetoric is not window-dressing on organizational structure — it is a co-equal design choice. Batch 11 reinforces the broader thesis that purpose claims are load-bearing rhetorical infrastructure enabling or constraining structural choices. UHG cannot build ambitious AI partly because it cannot talk about AI ambitiously — defensive rhetoric constrains deployment scope. Delta can deploy slowly because 'augmented intelligence' framing authorizes patience. TR can acquire aggressively because its two-voice strategy makes acquisitions legible as both organizational learning and customer service.",

Super-modularity predicts that organizations doing both coherently will outperform those doing one well and the other poorly. Connects to the broader complementarities literature (Brynjolfsson & Milgrom 2013 on IT and organizational practices): just as IT investment requires complementary organizational redesign, AI transformation requires complementary rhetorical redesign.

      "maturity": "emerging",
      "finding": "CEOs range from total monopoly over AI purpose rhetoric to complete silence on AI, and the position on this spectrum is itself an organizational design choice that complements structural decisions.\n\n**Sole-voice monopolists** (Uber, Anduril, Disney, Netflix): The CEO or founder makes ALL purpose claims about AI. No CTO, Chief Scientist, or CAIO is publicly visible in the purpose narrative. Khosrowshahi (16/16 claims), Luckey (12/12), Iger (14/14), Sarandos (13/14). This pattern signals that AI is a *CEO-level strategic concern*, not a technical one. The structural complement: these organizations typically don't have a strong separate AI exploration unit — the CEO IS the exploration mandate.\n\n**Distributed speakers** (Toyota, Honeywell, Novo Nordisk): Multiple leaders make purpose claims, each in their own rhetorical register. This signals structural differentiation: AI has been organizationally distributed, and meaning-making rights have been distributed along with decision rights.\n\n**CEO silence** (Nike): Hill makes ZERO AI claims despite being CEO of a company undergoing AI transformation. All AI rhetoric came from the CTO — and then the CTO role was eliminated in December 2025. The structural decision (killing the CTO role) *enacts* the rhetorical choice (AI is not part of this CEO's identity). This is the strongest evidence that some organizations are deliberately de-emphasizing AI in their purpose narrative, and the rhetorical de-emphasis and structural de-emphasis are complementary moves.\n\nThe spectrum from sole-voice to silence maps predictably to organizational strategy: sole-voice CEOs are making AI-as-strategic-transformation bets; distributed speakers have operationalized AI across the org; silent CEOs are either deliberately subordinating AI to other priorities (Nike: sport identity) or haven't yet decided AI is CEO-level. Batch 11 M4 specimens reveal three new patterns beyond monopoly/silence/distribution: (1) strategic CEO silence as risk management (UHG — CEO can't afford AI association due to governance scandal), (2) coordinated duet with register specialization (TR — CEO does investor framing, CTO does identity framing, exactly 8 claims each), (3) rhetorical cascade where CEO-level formulations appear nearly verbatim in product manager statements (Deere — 'do more with less' cascades from CEO to PM level).",

These are Coasean purpose claims — statements where leaders, whether knowingly or not, engage with the theory of the firm.\n\n**Uber — Khosrowshahi (Davos 2024):** 'What's a company? Essentially, it's a rule. It's a bunch of policies... What if, instead of a static set of guidelines, those rules could reason through every possible scenario?' This is practically a Coase (1937) paraphrase: the firm exists to reduce transaction costs via internal coordination rules, and AI may replace those coordination mechanisms. If AI can 'reason through every possible scenario,' the coordination rationale for the firm dissolves.\n\n**Satya Nadella (multiple contexts):** Has explicitly referenced Coase's theory — 'The Coase argument for why firms exist is that there are transaction costs... AI is changing the nature of those costs.' This is the most explicitly theoretical CEO statement in the collection.\n\n**McKinsey — Sternfels:** The '60K entities' framing (40K humans + 25K AI agents) implicitly treats AI agents as organizational members, blurring the firm boundary between human and machine labor. If agents are members, what does the firm boundary contain?\n\nThese claims are important because they reveal leaders grappling, in real time, with the foundational questions that organizational economists study: What is the firm? What determines its boundaries? What holds it together? Most purpose claims operate at the strategic level (what should we do about AI). Coasean claims operate at the ontological level (what IS the organization, and does AI change that answer). \n\nWe should flag these systematically.

The rhetorical work is not hiding commercial interest behind moral language — it is finding the moral frame that makes commercial action feel justified to multiple audiences simultaneously (employees, investors, regulators, customers). This is consistent with a relational contract interpretation (Gibbons & Henderson): shared purpose narratives reduce coordination costs by providing a common justification that doesn't require explicit agreement on whether the motivation is moral or commercial. The claim works precisely because it is both at once.

Without a teleological anchor, an AI-first organization has no answer to 'why do you exist?' beyond 'to build AI,' which is tautological. This is analytically distinct from utopian claims (which invoke an epoch) — teleological claims specify a CONCRETE, potentially falsifiable end. M1 (Research Lab) shows a correlated pattern: near-zero higher-calling (1.8%) but moderate teleological. The mechanism is different: M1 labs justify existence through discovery (teleological: 'cure disease') rather than duty (higher-calling: 'we owe the world'). Sample size caveat: only 10 M9 specimens in the collection. Pattern is strong but needs confirmation as the M9 sample grows.",

Headquarters pushes harder precisely because their dashboard says it's working. The overcorrection is driven by measurement failure, not managerial hubris. This connects two insights: measurement-driven-moral-hazard provides the MECHANISM; inverse-grove describes the BEHAVIORAL PATTERN. Together they form a testable causal chain: biased metrics → bounded-rational escalation → organizational overcorrection → quality degradation → (optional) forced reversal.
