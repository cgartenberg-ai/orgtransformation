    "rationale": "Uber has a central AI Labs research function (founded 2016) that conducts fundamental research while also connecting with product/operational teams. This 'Core and Connections' model is explicitly hub-and-spoke: central standards with distributed execution. Additionally, Uber AI Solutions (formerly Scaled Solutions) operates as a semi-independent unit commercializing AI data services externally. AV work is handled via partnerships (Waymo, Aurora) rather than internal build, suggesting they divested from the skunkworks model (ATG) and moved to partnership-based execution.",
    "aiTeamStructure": "Uber AI Labs serves as the central research hub (founded Dec 2016), structured with two programs: 'Core' for fundamental research and 'Connections' for working with product teams across rideshare, Eats, freight, and self-driving. The lab was seeded by acquiring Geometric Intelligence (15-person team). Additionally, Uber AI Solutions (rebranded from Scaled Solutions) is a data labeling/annotation business unit serving both internal needs and external clients (Aurora, Niantic). The broader Uber AI group has ~96 employees across 5 teams. Toronto hub exists for AV-focused AI research. No CAIO role exists; AI reports through engineering/product leadership.",

  "summary": "Uber operates a Hybrid/Hub-and-Spoke model for AI: Uber AI Labs (founded 2016, ~96 people across 5 teams) serves as the central research hub with explicit 'Core' (fundamental research) and 'Connections' (product integration) programs, while AI for routing, pricing, and matching is embedded in platform engineering. Autonomous vehicle work has shifted from internal build (ATG divested 2020) to partnership model (Waymo, Aurora, NVIDIA). Uber AI Solutions is a distinct business unit that commercializes data labeling capabilities externally. CEO Khosrowshahi articulates a vision of 'real' AI transformation (not 'play-acting'), exemplified by rebuilding customer service from scratch to let AI 'reason' rather than follow rigid rules.",

  "openQuestions": [
    "What is Zoubin Ghahramani's current scope and reporting relationship? Is AI Labs still active under that name or evolved?",
    "How large is the AI Solutions (data labeling) business unit? Revenue? Headcount?",
    "Did Raquel Urtasun and the Toronto hub remain after ATG divestiture, or did they move to Aurora?",
    "What is the budget allocation between internal AI R&D vs. AV partnership investments?",
    "How is the Conversational AI team (hands-free voice assistant) structured relative to AI Labs?"
  ],

  "conferenceFindings": "No specific AI/tech conference presence identified in search. Key public appearances for AI topics: World Economic Forum Davos 2026 (Khosrowshahi on AI adoption philosophy), Brown University SPS event (April 2025), Goldman Sachs Talks at GS (Nov 2025). Earnings calls remain primary source for AV strategy updates."
