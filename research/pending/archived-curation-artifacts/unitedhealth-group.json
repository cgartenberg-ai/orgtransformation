  "summary": "UnitedHealth Group operates the largest healthcare AI deployment in the US with 1,000+ production use cases, 20,000 engineers, and $1.5B annual AI investment. Structure is classic hub-and-spoke: central governance (Responsible AI Board, United AI Studio platform) with distributed execution across UnitedHealthcare, Optum, and OptumRx. Optum Labs serves as the research arm with academic partnerships. Key tension: massive AI deployment under DOJ scrutiny for potential use in claims denial, despite official policy that AI is 'never used to deny a claim.'",

  "openQuestions": [
    "Exact reporting lines for Chief AI Scientist (Pencina) vs Chief AI Transformation Officer (Mohiuddin) vs CDTO (Dadlani) - who reports to whom?",
    "Size and composition of Optum Labs team specifically",
    "What percentage of $1.5B tech investment is specifically AI vs broader technology?",
    "How DOJ investigation affecting AI deployment strategy",
    "Stephen Hemsley's AI priorities since returning as CEO - no interviews found yet"
  ],

  "conferenceFindings": "No major AI conference presence found (AWS re:Invent, Google Cloud Next, etc.). Andrew Witty spoke at Forbes Healthcare Summit (2022) and BofA Securities Healthcare Conference about integration strategy. Annual investor conference in December is primary venue for AI announcements. UnitedHealth appears to avoid high-profile external AI conference circuit, preferring controlled investor/healthcare industry venues."
