CEO Taiclet explicitly describes this as applying AI 'across hundreds of projects' with central standards and distributed execution. The creation of Astris AI as a commercial subsidiary (M5c pattern) adds a product dimension, but the core structural model is hybrid/hub-and-spoke.",

  "summary": "Lockheed Martin operates a mature Hybrid/Hub-and-Spoke AI model centered on the Lockheed Martin AI Center (LAIC), established 2021. The hub provides centralized compute (NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD processing 1B+ tokens/week), MLOps tools, training, and governance to 7,000 engineers across all business areas. Mike Baylor as CDAIO leads a 300+ person data/analytics function with Greg Forrest directing AI Foundations. The June 2025 appointment of Craig Martell (former DoD CDAO) as CTO signals serious AI ambition. CEO Taiclet's '21st Century Security' vision explicitly links AI to national defense, with partnerships spanning NVIDIA, Meta, IBM, Microsoft, and others. The December 2024 launch of Astris AI subsidiary extends AI Factory capabilities commercially.",

  "openQuestions": [
    "How does AI work flow between classified and unclassified environments? The AI Factory handles both, but the governance mechanisms are unclear.",
    "What is the precise reporting relationship between CDAIO Baylor and CEO Taiclet? Is Baylor C-suite or VP level?",
    "How does the new CTO Craig Martell's role interact with CDAIO Baylor's? Is there a division between AI/digital (Baylor) and broader tech (Martell)?",
    "What specific AI capabilities are deployed in programs like F-35, Aegis, or missile defense? Details are classified.",
    "What is the budget breakdown between AI Factory infrastructure, AI research, and AI product integration?"
  ],

  "conferenceFindings": "No major AI-focused conference appearances found. Taiclet has spoken at CSIS and testified before House Armed Services Committee on 21st Century Security, but no keynotes at AI-specific conferences like GTC, AI Summit, or similar. Lockheed Martin appears to communicate AI strategy through defense industry channels and congressional testimony rather than tech industry conferences."
