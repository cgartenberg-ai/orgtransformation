      "researchImplication": "This is potentially a paper-worthy finding: the same technology, same sector, different governance outcomes based on organizational form (payer vs. provider). Information asymmetry and misaligned incentives (payer profits from denials, provider profits from approvals) create structurally different AI objective functions."
