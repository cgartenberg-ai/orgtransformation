      "detail": "The SpaceX-xAI merger ($1.25T combined) represents a structural form distinct from traditional conglomerates, holding companies, or multi-divisional firms. Instead of a corporate parent allocating capital across divisions, a single individual (Musk) directly controls multiple companies that share infrastructure (compute, power, manufacturing) and transfer capabilities (AI models from xAI orchestrating Tesla robots). This is closer to a Chandlerian vertically integrated firm than a financial conglomerate, but held together by personal control rather than corporate governance.",

      "detail": "Musk's insistence on 'engineer' over 'researcher' at xAI, combined with his attack on competitors who 'say they're labs' but are really profit-maximizing corporations, reveals that organizational identity labels are contested terrain in AI. The choice between 'lab' and 'engineering shop' signals different structural orientations: labs prioritize discovery and publications, engineering shops prioritize production and deployment. This maps to our exploration vs execution taxonomy.",

      "detail": "Mollick's Wharton experiment and his broader argument suggest that the bottleneck for organizational AI effectiveness is management skill (scoping, delegation, evaluation) rather than AI technical capability. This has structural implications: organizations should invest in management development rather than AI technical training, and should place domain experts (not AI specialists) in charge of AI-augmented work. This aligns with economic logic — the scarce input (management judgment) commands the premium, not the abundant input (compute).",

      "detail": "Even elite software developers at major AI labs report shifting from direct programming to managing AI agents. If this transformation is happening at the technical frontier, it will propagate to less technical organizations. This has structural implications for job design, reporting relationships, and how organizations define 'technical' vs 'managerial' roles. The traditional dichotomy between technical and managerial career tracks may be collapsing.",
