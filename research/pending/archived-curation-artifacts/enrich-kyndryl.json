    "aiLeadership": "No Chief AI Officer. AI falls under Michael Bradshaw, SVP & Global Practice Leader for Applications, Data and AI (appointed July 2024, previously Kyndryl CIO). Antoine Shagoury is Global CTO. CEO Martin Schroeter sets AI-as-infrastructure strategic narrative. Ismail Amla (SVP Kyndryl Consult) leads agentic AI workforce transformation services. Nel Akoth is Chief Transformation Officer. Giovanni Carraro (SVP Global Strategic Alliances) leads partner-facing AI agent work (e.g., 100 agents in 100 days with Google Cloud). Dennis Perpetua is CTO for Digital Workplace Services. Kristi Cunningham is US CTO.",
    "teamStructure": "Kyndryl organizes AI work through a practice-based model, not a centralized AI unit. Five Global Practice areas: (1) Applications, Data and AI (Bradshaw), (2) Cloud (Nicolas Sekkaki), (3) Core Enterprise and zCloud (Hassan Zamat), (4) Cyber Security and Resiliency, Network and Edge (Paul Savill), (5) Digital Workplace (Ivan Dopple). Kyndryl Consult (Amla) is the consulting/advisory arm that delivers agentic AI organizational change management. Kyndryl Bridge is the AI-powered IT management platform (1,200+ customers, 190 services) — it is the operational backbone, not a separate AI team. A cross-functional governance committee evaluates and approves AI use cases for regulatory/risk alignment. AI Innovation Labs established in Liverpool and Singapore.",
    "reportingLines": "Practice leaders (Bradshaw, Sekkaki, Zamat, Savill, Dopple) appear to report to Group President Elly Keinan or directly to CEO Schroeter. CTO Shagoury is a separate technology leadership role. CIO Kim Basile (appointed July 2024, replacing Bradshaw) handles internal IT. The July 2024 reshuffle was significant: Bradshaw moved from CIO to lead the new Applications, Data and AI practice; Sekkaki moved from Applications/Data/AI to Cloud. This swap suggests Schroeter wanted Bradshaw's operational CIO experience applied to AI commercialization.",

    },
    "classificationNotes": "Current classification M2/Structural (Stub) needs significant upgrade. The practice-based model with a dedicated Applications, Data and AI practice under Bradshaw is more sophisticated than a single CoE. However, Kyndryl's AI structure is heavily customer-facing — their AI work is primarily about helping clients adopt AI, not about internal AI transformation of their own operations. The Kyndryl Bridge platform is an AI-powered product (operational AI), not an exploratory AI research unit. Recommend reclassifying to M2/Structural or possibly M5 (Practice-Embedded) at Medium completeness. Key structural features: (1) Practice-based model with AI distributed across practices rather than centralized, (2) Agentic AI Framework as horizontal methodology, (3) Cross-functional governance committee for use case approval, (4) Alliance-driven agent development model. The July 2024 leadership swap (Bradshaw CIO→AI, Sekkaki AI→Cloud) is a telling structural signal — putting an operator in charge of AI commercialization."
  },
  "enrichmentSummary": "Kyndryl's AI structure is far richer than the stub suggested. No CAIO exists; AI is led by Michael Bradshaw (SVP, Applications Data and AI practice, appointed July 2024 after serving as CIO). The company organizes AI through five practice areas plus Kyndryl Consult, with a cross-functional governance committee and the Bridge platform (1,200+ customers) as operational backbone. Financially, the company is profitable but under significant pressure — Q3 FY2026 missed estimates, stock fell 25%, guidance was cut, and interim CFO/GC appointments signal leadership instability. Headcount has declined from ~90,000 at spinoff to ~60,000. Hyperscaler revenue ($500M/quarter, +58% YoY) and AI-inclusive contracts (25% of signings) are the main growth story."
