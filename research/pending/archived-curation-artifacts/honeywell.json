  "summary": "Honeywell operates a Hybrid/Hub-and-Spoke AI structure with clear separation between internal AI (CDTO Sheila Jordan) and product AI (CTO Suresh Venkatarayalu). A central gen AI program leader manages an 'ambassador' network across all functions and business units, governed by a 'six-chapter framework' covering employee workflows through sales effectiveness. CEO Vimal Kapur frames AI as solving industrial labor shortages rather than replacing workers, with a strategic vision of moving from 'automated' to 'autonomous' operations through what he calls 'physical AI.'",

  "openQuestions": [
    "Exact size of central AI team vs. distributed ambassadors",
    "Specific budget allocation for AI initiatives",
    "How AI organization will change post-3-way split (Aerospace, Automation, Advanced Materials)",
    "Details on the gen AI Academy curriculum and scale",
    "Quantinuum's role in overall AI strategy (quantum vs. classical AI)"
  ],

  "conferenceFindings": "No specific AI conference appearances found. Kapur spoke at Davos 2026 about 'automation, data, and physical AI' as core pillars. No evidence of major AI-specific conference keynotes (NeurIPS, AI Summit, etc.)."
