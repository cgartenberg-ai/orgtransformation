    "rationale": "Visa appears to have a distinct centralized research function (Visa Research) with dedicated AI scientists, while also embedding AI capabilities across products (fraud detection, agentic commerce, VisaNet). The presence of both a dedicated research organization and distributed product AI suggests a hub-and-spoke model. Visa Research sets standards and conducts foundational work, while product teams deploy AI in specific domains. However, full organizational clarity is limited — we didn't find a Chief AI Officer or clear reporting lines for AI leadership.",

Led by Senior Directors (Yiwei Cai for Trustworthy AI, Anderson Nascimento for Security Research). Approximately 24+ research scientists identified in the AI/ML team. Sam Hamilton serves as SVP, Head of Data & AI Platforms. Wang Min has been SVP of Visa Research Labs since 2015. Technology overall reports to Rajat Taneja (President of Technology).

  "summary": "Visa operates a Hybrid/Hub-and-Spoke model for AI, with a dedicated Visa Research organization (~24+ scientists) conducting foundational AI research alongside distributed AI deployment in products (fraud detection, agentic commerce, VisaNet). CEO McInerney frames AI as powered by Visa's data advantage ('arguably the largest global payments data set') and has committed billions to AI-driven cybersecurity. No Chief AI Officer exists; AI leadership is distributed across Data & AI Platforms (Sam Hamilton, SVP), Visa Research Labs (Wang Min, SVP), and Technology (Rajat Taneja, President).",

  "openQuestions": [
    "Specific AI headcount beyond the ~24 research scientists",
    "What percentage of R&D budget goes to AI specifically",
    "How AI decisions are governed across research vs. product teams",
    "Whether there are plans to create a Chief AI Officer role",
    "How the 'Visa Intelligent Commerce' initiative is organizationally structured"
  ],

  "conferenceFindings": "McInerney has presented at JPMorgan Global Technology Media & Communications Conference (May 2025), Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference (May 2024), and Goldman Sachs Communacopia (September 2023). Bloomberg Talks podcast featured him discussing AI's impact on advertising and agentic commerce. CNBC interviews at Visa Payments Forum covered AI-powered products."
