The Windreich Department of AI and Human Health creates central 'AI Fabric' infrastructure while distributed teams (Clinical Data Science, Digital Technology Partners) deploy to specific clinical contexts. Chief AI Officer Nadkarni explicitly advocates for 'infrastructure that spans the enterprise' with a 'hub-and-satellite model to make new tools and techniques available to all Mount Sinai physicians.'",
    "aiTeamStructure": "Three-pillar structure: (1) Windreich Department of AI and Human Health - first such academic department in a US medical school, led by CAIO Girish Nadkarni, focused on research and enterprise AI infrastructure; (2) Digital Technology Partners (DTP) led by CDTO Robbie Freeman, focused on clinical deployment and patient/workforce digital products; (3) Clinical Data Science Team (created 2017) focused on real-time ML/AI for clinical intervention. The Hamilton and Amabel James Center houses ~40 Principal Investigators and 250+ graduate students, postdocs, computer scientists, and support staff. Additional specialized centers include the Center for AI in Children's Health and a digital pathology Center of Excellence (with Labcorp).",

  "summary": "Mount Sinai Health System operates a mature Hybrid/Hub-and-Spoke AI model with the Hamilton and Amabel James Center for AI and Human Health as the central hub—a 65,000 sq ft, 12-story facility housing the first AI department at a US medical school. Chief AI Officer Girish Nadkarni leads enterprise infrastructure and research, while Chief Digital Transformation Officer Robbie Freeman leads clinical deployment. The organization emphasizes 'culture over cutting-edge models,' with centralized governance, distributed idea generation, and a human-in-the-loop philosophy for all clinical AI.",

  "openQuestions": [
    "Specific budget/investment figures for AI initiatives",
    "Total AI headcount across the three pillars (Windreich, DTP, Clinical Data Science)",
    "Details on the relationship between CEO Brendan Carr and AI leadership",
    "Specific HIMSS 2026 presentation content on nursing informatics and human-AI partnership"
  ],

  "conferenceFindings": "Mount Sinai was flagged for HIMSS 2026 participation on nursing informatics and human-AI partnership. This aligns with CDTO Robbie Freeman's nursing informatics background—he previously served as Chief Nursing Informatics Officer before becoming CDTO. His emphasis on 'human-in-the-loop' and work with the American Nurses Association on safe/ethical AI use directly connects to the conference theme. No specific HIMSS 2026 presentation content found, but the organizational philosophy is well-documented."
