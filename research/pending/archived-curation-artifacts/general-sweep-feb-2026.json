The CAIO mandate is to promote deep integration of AI within and outside the company — deploying AI for customer challenges and streamlining internal operations. The SRO role coordinates cross-functional initiatives and optimizes profit structures by dismantling departmental silos. CEO Yuki Kusumi identified 2026 as the 'key year for achieving growth phase transition.' The dual appointment signals Panasonic is restructuring to break down siloed manufacturing BU structures using generative AI and automation.",
