    "rationale": "Disney has a multi-layered AI structure: (1) Disney Research Studios in Zurich (16+ years, fundamental research in visual computing/ML/AI), (2) Office of Technology Enablement led by Jamie Voris (new in 2024, ~100 employees, governance/enablement layer), and (3) distributed AI work in business units (Disney+, Parks, Studios). This is classic hub-and-spoke: central standards and research capability with distributed execution. The $1B OpenAI partnership adds a strategic external partnership layer. Structural orientation because exploration (Research Studios, OTE) and execution (business unit AI) are in distinct organizational units.",
    "aiTeamStructure": "Three distinct AI-related structures: (1) DISNEY RESEARCH STUDIOS - 16+ year old research lab in Zurich, Switzerland with additional locations in Los Angeles and Pittsburgh. Led by Chief Scientist Markus Gross. World-class research in visual computing, machine learning, and AI for filmmaking. Close partnership with ETH Zürich. Research feeds into all Disney film studios (WDAS, Pixar, ILM, Marvel). (2) OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY ENABLEMENT (OTE) - New unit established November 2024. Led by Jamie Voris (former 14-year CTO of Walt Disney Studios). Reports to Alan Bergman (Co-chairman, Disney Entertainment). Expected to grow to ~100 employees. Mission: establish Disney as 'progressive, innovative, and responsible leader' in AI and Mixed Reality. Does NOT centralize or take over business unit AI projects; instead provides governance, standards, and enablement across Entertainment, ESPN, and Parks. (3) STUDIOLAB - Facility on Walt Disney Studio Lot for exploring cutting-edge tech, with Accenture as founding Innovation Partner.",

  "summary": "Disney operates a sophisticated Hybrid/Hub-and-Spoke AI structure with three main layers: (1) Disney Research Studios, a 16+ year fundamental research operation in Zurich led by Chief Scientist Markus Gross, focused on visual computing, ML, and AI for filmmaking; (2) the new Office of Technology Enablement led by Jamie Voris (~100 employees), providing AI/XR governance and enablement across all business segments without centralizing execution; and (3) the $1B OpenAI partnership (December 2025) for Sora integration into Disney+. CEO Bob Iger is extremely vocal about AI as 'the most powerful technology' Disney has seen, framing it as 'wind behind our backs' rather than a threat, while maintaining three guardrails: IP protection, creator respect, and customer value.",

  "openQuestions": [
    "What is the budget/headcount for Disney Research Studios?",
    "How does AI work integrate between Research Studios and the new Office of Technology Enablement?",
    "What specific AI capabilities has Disney deployed in Parks/Experiences beyond announced initiatives?",
    "How did SAG-AFTRA AI negotiations shape Disney's structural approach to AI governance?",
    "What is the role of Imagineering in AI development for park experiences?",
    "How will the CEO transition to Josh D'Amaro affect AI strategy and investment levels?"
  ],

  "conferenceFindings": "No major AI-focused conference presentations found. Iger spoke at Canva Create (May 2024) where he was an investor/board member - discussed technology embracing philosophy. No dedicated Disney AI conference presence identified in tech/AI conference circuit."
