    "rationale": "ExxonMobil has a centralized technology organization that integrates IT with traditional technology, but has no formal AI lab, CAIO, or branded AI center. AI work is coordinated through Global Business Services (GBS) unit for enterprise-wide process automation and efficiency. The company has AI-specific roles (AI Operations Manager, Digital Transformation Lead) but these are embedded within broader IT/technology functions rather than a standalone AI organization. CEO Darren Woods has stated the company uses AI for 'effectiveness rather than just cost efficiency' as a 'long-term evolution' — suggesting contextual ambidexterity where individuals balance exploration and execution within their roles. The $15B cost savings target by 2027 positions AI as an enabler of operational excellence rather than a separate exploration unit.",
    "aiTeamStructure": "No dedicated AI lab or formal AI organization. AI work is distributed across: (1) Global Business Services (GBS) unit - responsible for end-to-end processes and enterprise-wide AI deployment; (2) AI Operations team within IT - led by Sarah Karthigan, focused on self-healing strategies and data science; (3) Technology organization that integrates IT with traditional engineering technology. LinkedIn suggests approximately 668 data scientists across the company, but these are embedded in business units rather than a centralized AI team.",

  "summary": "ExxonMobil operates an unnamed/informal AI structure (Model 6b) where AI capabilities are coordinated through Global Business Services and embedded within a centralized technology organization, rather than a formal AI lab or branded center. The company has approximately 668 data scientists distributed across business units, with key roles including an AI Operations Manager (Sarah Karthigan) and Digital Transformation Lead (Dr. Xiaojung Huang). CEO Darren Woods frames AI as enabling long-term operational effectiveness with a $15B cost savings target by 2027, while simultaneously positioning ExxonMobil as an energy supplier to the AI/data center industry.",

  "openQuestions": [
    "What is the actual AI budget or spending within the $27-29B annual CapEx?",
    "How does the AI Operations team size compare to other energy majors?",
    "What is the governance structure for AI decisions - who approves new AI initiatives?",
    "Is the IBM Cloud Pak partnership ongoing or was it a one-time engagement?",
    "How does the Pioneer acquisition affect AI capabilities and integration?"
  ],

  "conferenceFindings": "No known AI-specific conference presence identified. Darren Woods appears at energy/climate conferences (CERAWeek, COP29, Milken Institute) but AI is not a primary topic - mentioned only as data center energy opportunity."
