  "summary": "T-Mobile operates a Hybrid/Hub-and-Spoke AI model with a central AI-RAN Innovation Center in Bellevue, WA (partnering with NVIDIA, Ericsson, Nokia) focused on network AI, while AI responsibilities for customer-facing applications are distributed across the CIO, CPO, and President of Innovation. No dedicated CAIO exists. Key initiatives include IntentCX (with OpenAI) for customer service AI and AI-RAN for network optimization. The company is transitioning from Mike Sievert's infrastructure-focused tenure to Srini Gopalan's 'AI-driven digital transformation' era.",

  "openQuestions": [
    "What is the exact size of T-Mobile's internal AI/ML team? (Job postings suggest teams exist but headcount unclear)",
    "How does the AI-RAN Innovation Center report into the corporate structure?",
    "What is the total investment level in AI initiatives?",
    "What is the status of IntentCX deployment since 2025 launch?",
    "How does Gopalan's AI strategy differ from Sievert's?",
    "What metrics does T-Mobile use internally to track AI initiative success beyond the 75% customer interaction reduction target?"
  ],

  "conferenceFindings": "No specific conference presence noted in research. Sievert delivered CES 2022 keynote (pre-AI era) and has appeared at Goldman Sachs 'Talks at GS'. The upcoming Q4 2025 earnings call and Capital Markets Day on February 11, 2026 may reveal more AI strategy details."
