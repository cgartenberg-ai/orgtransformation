    "suggestedModel": 6,
    "suggestedModelName": "Unnamed/Informal - Enterprise-Wide Adoption (6a)",
    "suggestedOrientation": "Contextual",
    "confidence": "High",
    "rationale": "Blue Origin has achieved remarkable AI adoption (70%+ of employees using AI agents monthly, 95% of software engineers using AI for coding) without a dedicated AI lab, CAIO, or formal AI-branded organizational unit. Instead, they built an internal platform (BlueGPT) and expect 'everyone at Blue Origin to build and collaborate with AI agents.' This is textbook Model 6a - enterprise-wide adoption with informal/unnamed structure. The orientation is clearly Contextual: individuals balance both exploration and execution within their roles, with engineers and manufacturing teams using AI agents for their core work rather than a separate exploration unit.",
    "aiTeamStructure": "No dedicated AI lab or Chief AI Officer. AI work is led by Enterprise Technology under VP William Brennan. Blue Origin built an internal AI platform called 'BlueGPT' - a secure LLM gateway, agent marketplace, and multi-agent orchestration system. The company has deployed 2,700+ AI agents across engineering, manufacturing, software, and supply chain teams. Everyone at Blue Origin is expected to build and collaborate with AI agents - this is democratized adoption, not a centralized AI team.",

    ],
    "investmentSignals": "No public financials (private company). Revenue estimated at $5B annually. 11,000 employees. 2,700+ AI agents deployed. 3.5 million AI interactions monthly. Heavy investment in AWS partnership for AI infrastructure (Amazon Bedrock, Amazon EKS, Amazon OpenSearch, etc.).",
    "observableMarkers": {
      "reportingStructure": "AI reports through Enterprise Technology (VP William Brennan), not a dedicated CAIO or AI lab structure. CEO Dave Limp has strong AI background (led Alexa at Amazon).",

  "summary": "Blue Origin exemplifies Model 6a (Enterprise-Wide Adoption without formal AI structure). The company has deployed 2,700+ AI agents with 70% company-wide adoption through an internal platform called BlueGPT, but has no dedicated AI lab, CAIO, or formally branded AI organization. The expectation is that 'everyone at Blue Origin builds and collaborates with AI agents' - a contextual ambidexterity approach where individuals balance exploration and execution in their roles. VP of Enterprise Technology William Brennan leads the AI transformation, with CEO Dave Limp (former Amazon Alexa leader) emphasizing AI proficiency as a workforce competence.",

  "openQuestions": [
    "What is the budget/headcount specifically allocated to BlueGPT platform development?",
    "How is the AI agent marketplace governed - who approves agents, what standards apply?",
    "What is the relationship between Blue Origin's internal AI work and Jeff Bezos's separate Project Prometheus AI lab?",
    "How does AI work integrate with Blue Origin's core engineering/manufacturing organizations structurally?",
    "What specific AI capabilities are being developed for autonomous space operations vs. internal productivity?"
  ],

  "conferenceFindings": "AWS re:Invent 2025 was the key event. William Brennan (VP Enterprise Technology) presented on Blue Origin's agentic AI deployment. Key revelations: (1) 2,700+ agents deployed, (2) 70% company-wide adoption, (3) BlueGPT platform architecture on AWS, (4) T-Rex project - 'world's first AI agent-designed hardware' for lunar operations, (5) Vision of 'small teams of 2-3 working with large teams of AI agents.' This was the richest source of structural AI data for the company."
