      "theoreticalImplication": "Goldman accepted speed-to-deployment tradeoff for flexibility. Morgan Stanley prioritized early proof-of-concept to build organizational confidence. JPMorgan used scale/spending to pursue both simultaneously."

      "theoreticalRelevance": "The CDAO title bundles data governance + AI adoption + analytics -- suggesting banks see these as inseparable. The question is whether this bundle is a transitional role or a permanent structural feature."
