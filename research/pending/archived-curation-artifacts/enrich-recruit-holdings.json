    "aiLeadership": "CEO Hisayuki 'Deko' Idekoba returned as President and CEO of Indeed (effective June 2, 2025) while maintaining his role as Representative Director, President and CEO of Recruit Holdings. This dual-hat arrangement centralizes AI transformation authority at the very top. Chris Hyams (Indeed CEO 2019-2025) stepped down but remained as advisor through end of 2025. Glassdoor CEO Christian Sutherland-Wong departed October 1, 2025. Raj Mukherjee served as EVP, Marketplace Product & UX at Indeed, leading product, AI innovation and UX teams — key AI product leader. LaFawn Davis (Chief People & Sustainability Officer) also departed during restructuring.",
    "teamStructure": "Recruit Holdings operates through three Strategic Business Units (SBUs): HR Technology (Indeed + Glassdoor), Matching & Solutions (renamed Marketing Matching Technologies in FY2025), and Staffing. The July 2025 restructuring consolidated Glassdoor operations into Indeed's framework, eliminating Glassdoor as a separate operating entity with independent leadership. Indeed has a dedicated Responsible AI team (interdisciplinary: computer science, sociology, astrophysics). Indeed's AI matching system runs on a centralized HDFS repository in their Austin data center, processing billions of input signals daily from 200 million monthly unique visitors. The recommendation engine evolved from Apache Mahout to a hybrid offline/online pipeline. Indeed also partnered with OpenAI to add contextual 'why' explanations to job recommendations, with rigorous A/B testing starting 2023.",
    "reportingLines": "Idekoba sits atop both Recruit Holdings (parent) and Indeed (largest subsidiary), creating direct parent-to-subsidiary CEO alignment on AI strategy. Glassdoor no longer has independent CEO — folded under Indeed. Raj Mukherjee (EVP Marketplace Product & UX) led AI innovation and product teams, reporting into Indeed CEO. No separate Chief AI Officer or VP of AI identified — AI appears embedded in product/engineering rather than having a dedicated central AI org.",

    "classificationNotes": "Current M6 (Acqui-structural Portfolio) classification seems wrong. Recruit Holdings is better classified as M7 (AI-Native Rebuild) or possibly M3 (Shadow Promotion) depending on how you read the Idekoba dual-hat move. The key structural pattern is: (1) Parent CEO personally takes over subsidiary CEO role to drive AI transformation — this is a rare 'founder returns' pattern; (2) Subsidiary absorption — Glassdoor loses independent leadership and is folded into Indeed; (3) Massive workforce reduction (~4,500 over 3 years) while investing in AI; (4) AI embedded in product/engineering rather than centralized AI org — no Chief AI Officer. The orientation is clearly Temporal (Sequential): first cut and consolidate, then rebuild with AI. The dual-hat CEO structure is the most distinctive feature — it's essentially a parent company executing a hostile takeover of its own subsidiary's strategy to force AI transformation. Completeness should move from Low to Medium given these findings."
  },
  "enrichmentSummary": "Recruit Holdings' AI transformation is driven by a rare dual-hat CEO structure: Idekoba returned as Indeed CEO (June 2025) while remaining parent company CEO, centralizing AI authority at the very top. The restructuring absorbed Glassdoor into Indeed (eliminating its independent CEO), cut ~4,500 workers over 3 years, and is deploying AI agents to customers. AI now writes a third of Indeed's code (targeting 50% by 2026), and the platform assists job seekers every 2.2 seconds. Key structural finding: AI is embedded in product/engineering (led by EVP Raj Mukherjee) rather than housed in a separate central AI organization — no Chief AI Officer exists."
