    "rationale": "Apple is reorganizing AI work along functional lines — splitting what was John Giannandrea's centralized AI team across multiple divisions (robotics under hardware, Siri under Vision Pro team, Foundation Models under Craig Federighi, other AI work under Sabih Khan and Eddy Cue). This is a classic hub-and-spoke model: central standards and research (now under Amar Subramanya for ML research, AI safety, and evaluation) with distributed execution in product groups. The Zurich Vision Lab and Shenzhen research facility suggest a geographically distributed research operation. Apple's functional organizational structure (organized around expertise rather than products) reinforces this hybrid model.",
    "aiTeamStructure": "Apple restructured its AI organization in late 2025. John Giannandrea (SVP Machine Learning & AI Strategy) stepped down, moving to an advisory role before retirement in Spring 2026. Amar Subramanya (former Microsoft AI VP and Google Gemini engineering head) became VP of AI, reporting to Craig Federighi. Subramanya's remit includes ML research, AI safety, and evaluation across device, edge, and cloud environments. Robotics moved under hardware chief (likely John Ternus), Siri under Vision Pro team (Mike Rockwell leading Siri redesign), and Foundation Models under Craig Federighi. Operations and Services elements moved under Sabih Khan and Eddy Cue respectively. Research labs in Zurich (Vision Lab), Shenzhen (China hub), and main operations in California and Seattle.",

  "summary": "Apple is restructuring its AI organization from a centralized model under John Giannandrea to a hybrid/hub-and-spoke model with AI work distributed across functional leaders (Federighi for Foundation Models/Siri, hardware for robotics, services under Cue, operations under Khan). The new VP of AI (Amar Subramanya, ex-Microsoft/Google) reports to Craig Federighi and provides central coordination for ML research, AI safety, and evaluation. This reflects Apple's traditional functional organizational structure applied to AI. Investment is massive ($500B+ US operations, custom AI chips, 12K hires with 40% in R&D focused on AI), and Cook has positioned AI as a 'once-in-a-generation shift' requiring Apple to 'spend what it takes to compete.'",

  "openQuestions": [
    "Exact size of Apple's AI team (estimates of 200+ researchers, but unclear)",
    "Specific R&D budget allocation to AI vs. other areas",
    "How decision rights work between Subramanya's central ML research role and distributed product teams",
    "Whether the Zurich Vision Lab and Shenzhen lab will gain or lose prominence under the new structure",
    "Details on the 'Baltra' custom AI server chip timeline and capabilities",
    "How the Google Foundation Models partnership will affect in-house model development",
    "Specific metrics Apple uses to measure AI success internally"
  ],

  "conferenceFindings": "Apple sponsors major ML conferences (NeurIPS 2025, EMNLP 2025) and publishes research openly through machinelearning.apple.com. No evidence of Apple executives giving keynotes at AI/ML conferences — consistent with Apple's historically secretive approach. Key executives (Cook, Federighi) discuss AI in product launch keynotes (WWDC) and earnings calls rather than research conferences."
