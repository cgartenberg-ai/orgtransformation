  "summary": "Sutter Health has built a robust Hybrid/Hub-and-Spoke AI structure, notably appointing a Chief AI Officer (Ashley Beecy, MD) in May 2025 — rare in healthcare. The organization operates a physical Innovation Center at SF Pier 1 as a hub for experimentation while deploying AI at enterprise scale across 21 hospitals through partnerships (Aidoc, Abridge, GE HealthCare, Hyro). A cross-functional governance structure vets each AI use case for patient safety. With 3,200+ physicians on ambient documentation tools and stated goals to become 'a leader in health care AI,' Sutter represents an unusually mature AI organizational model for a non-profit health system.",

  "openQuestions": [
    "What is Ashley Beecy's direct reporting structure — does she report to CEO Warner Thomas directly?",
    "What is Sutter's total AI investment budget or CapEx commitment?",
    "How does the cross-functional governance group make decisions — unanimous consent, executive override, etc.?",
    "What is the specific content of the AWS re:Invent 2025 presentation on clinical AI governance that prompted this scan?",
    "What is the size of the dedicated AI/innovation team at the Pier 1 Innovation Center?"
  ],

  "conferenceFindings": "The scan was prompted by Ashley Beecy's AWS re:Invent 2025 presentation on clinical AI governance. While we confirmed she is Sutter's CAIO and leads their AI governance approach, we did not find detailed content from the AWS presentation itself. Her governance focus aligns with the cross-functional vetting structure described in other sources."
