  "summary": "PepsiCo operates a Hybrid/Hub-and-Spoke model (M4) with a central transformation organization of 700-1,000 engineers/data scientists under CSTO Athina Kanioura, supported by Digital Hubs in Dallas and Barcelona serving as Centers of Excellence. The company is training all 330,000 employees on AI (contextual orientation), deploying agentic AI across contact centers, workforce, and logistics, and using digital twins for manufacturing optimization. AI governance flows through an AI Council/Steering Committee, with Kanioura's team orchestrating 'mission-based teams' for major transformational programs.",

  "openQuestions": [
    "What is the annual AI/digital budget allocation?",
    "How many of the 700-1,000 engineers are specifically AI/ML focused vs. general software?",
    "What are the specific metrics for the 'four or five big bets'?",
    "How does the AI Council/Steering Committee make decisions — consensus, executive veto, etc.?",
    "What is the relationship between the Stanford HAI partnership outputs and internal AI governance?"
  ],

  "conferenceFindings": "CES 2026: PepsiCo announced an 'industry-first' AI and digital twin collaboration with Siemens and NVIDIA during the opening keynote. Using Siemens Digital Twin Composer built on NVIDIA Omniverse to simulate facility upgrades for Frito-Lay U.S. operations, with plans to scale globally. Laguarta emphasized embedding AI 'from farm to shelf' across the entire value chain. This represents a shift to digital-first planning using physics-based digital twins and AI agents as 'co-designers' to simulate, validate, and optimize facility layouts before physical builds."
