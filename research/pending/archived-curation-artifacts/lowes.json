(3) Charlotte Tech Hub - 'center of excellence' for up to 2,000 tech associates. (4) Core AI/Data team under SVP Chandhu Nair focused on platform and scaling.

  "summary": "Lowe's has built a sophisticated hybrid/hub-and-spoke AI structure with multiple specialized units: Lowe's Innovation Labs (Kirkland, WA) handles long-horizon exploration in spatial computing and digital twins, an AI Transformation Office provides centralized governance using a four-metric vetting framework, a Charlotte Tech Hub serves as a center of excellence for up to 2,000 tech roles, and SVP Chandhu Nair leads the AI/Data platform team that abstracts complexity for developers across the enterprise. Under CEO Marvin Ellison and CDIO Seemantini Godbole, Lowe's has achieved enterprise-scale AI adoption (100-billion-token OpenAI milestone), with Mylow handling nearly 1 million customer questions monthly and driving 2x conversion rates online and 200 basis point CSAT improvements in stores.",

  "openQuestions": [
    "Specific size of Chandhu Nair's AI/Data team and exact reporting relationship to Godbole",
    "AI headcount vs. total tech headcount (2,000 in Tech Hub but unclear how many focus on AI)",
    "Specific CapEx or OpEx allocation to AI initiatives",
    "How Innovation Labs coordinates with the AI Transformation Office on project handoffs",
    "Whether the AI Transformation Office has dedicated headcount or is a governance committee",
    "Long-term roadmap for 'agentic commerce' mentioned in 2026 plans"
  ],

  "conferenceFindings": "NRF 2026 presence confirmed through search results indicating Lowe's showcased Mylow (AI virtual advisor) and visualization services. The Mylow chatbot is the centerpiece customer-facing AI, while visualization refers to tools like Style Your Space (GenAI room visualization) and the Apple Vision Pro kitchen remodel experience. Lowe's Innovation Labs' digital twin work (Babylon) demonstrated at NVIDIA GTC with Jensen Huang present. Ellison spoke at Morgan Stanley Consumer and Retail Conference and Business Roundtable CEO Workforce Forum in 2025."
