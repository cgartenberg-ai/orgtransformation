  "summary": "Ford exhibits a Hybrid/Hub-and-Spoke (M4) model with Structural ambidexterity. The company operates multiple specialized AI units: Latitude AI (550 employees) for autonomous driving, Greenfield Labs (~300 researchers) for human-centered research, FARIC for software/digital transformation, and a Doug Field-led skunkworks for affordable EVs. The Ford+ restructuring that separated EV, ICE, and commercial divisions represents classic structural separation of exploration and execution. CEO Jim Farley frames AI primarily through a workforce lens, warning that AI will 'replace half of white-collar workers' while advocating that AI should 'supercharge' rather than replace essential economy workers.",

  "openQuestions": [
    "What is Ford's total AI R&D budget as a percentage of overall R&D spend?",
    "How does AI governance work across Model e, Ford Blue, and Ford Pro divisions?",
    "What is the reporting relationship between Latitude AI and Ford corporate leadership?",
    "How does the ServiceTitan partnership specifically deploy AI in dealerships?",
    "What are Ford's specific metrics for AI deployment success across the industrial system?",
    "Who is the current CTO/Head of AI after Ken Washington departed (he left for Amazon)?",
    "How many AI/ML engineers work outside of Latitude AI in the core Ford organization?"
  ],

  "conferenceFindings": "No specific AI-focused conference presentations found for Ford. Jim Farley spoke at the 2025 Aspen Ideas Festival where he made prominent statements about AI's impact on white-collar jobs. He also appeared on Bloomberg TV's Wall Street Week and gave interviews to Axios, Fortune, and Semafor discussing AI and the essential economy. No evidence of Ford presenting at major AI conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, etc.) or enterprise tech conferences."
