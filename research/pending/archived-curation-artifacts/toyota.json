  "summary": "Toyota operates a multi-layered Hybrid/Hub-and-Spoke AI structure with clear structural separation between exploration and execution. Toyota Research Institute (TRI) serves as the research hub ($1B initial investment, led by Chief Scientist Gill Pratt) focusing on autonomous driving, robotics, and fundamental AI breakthroughs. Enterprise AI within TMNA (led by Brian Kursar) handles near-term enterprise adoption, achieving 20%+ developer productivity gains and manufacturing diagnosis improvements from 7 hours to 15 seconds. The Global AI Accelerator (GAIA) bridges research to production across 11 categories. The incoming CEO Kenta Kon (April 2026) brings direct experience from Woven by Toyota and candidly acknowledges Toyota is 'not as advanced as Tesla' in AI while pointing to Toyota's scale (10M annual sales, 150M vehicles in operation) as a data advantage.",

  "openQuestions": [
    "What is TRI's current headcount and budget (post-initial $1B investment)?",
    "How many people are in the Enterprise AI organization?",
    "What is the total AI R&D spend across Toyota Group companies?",
    "How does GAIA prioritize which technologies move from TRI to production?",
    "What specific AI capabilities is Woven by Toyota developing?",
    "How will the Sato → Kon CEO transition affect AI investment priorities?"
  ],

  "conferenceFindings": "The research task mentioned AWS re:Invent 2025 with Toyota presenting on Enterprise AI and dealer assistants. While we did not find direct conference transcript content, Brian Kursar's role description mentions 'In-Vehicle AI agent development initiatives' and customer-facing AI applications. The Enterprise AI organization's focus on 'real-time equipment health monitoring,' personalized customer service, and 'driver preferences' adjustment aligns with the conference topics. The dealer assistant capability likely connects to their knowledge accelerator work that provides new employees with 'expertise comparable to veterans with decades of experience.'"
