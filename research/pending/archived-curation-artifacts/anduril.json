Engineering is distributed across product divisions (Integrated Systems for Space/Intelligence, Air Dominance, Maritime, etc.) with AI/ML embedded in each. Internal Tools team (~280 people) supports 35+ product lines. No CAIO role exists because AI is not treated as a separate discipline requiring special leadership - it's assumed as baseline capability.",

  "summary": "Anduril is a definitional AI-Native (M9) organization founded in 2017 specifically to build AI-powered defense technology. There is no AI transformation happening because AI is the foundational DNA - the Lattice platform powers all products from drones to submarines to mixed reality helmets. At $30.5B valuation with $1B+ revenue and a $22B IVAS contract from Microsoft, Anduril has validated the AI-native defense model. Palmer Luckey serves as chief evangelist and vision-setter, though Brian Schimpf is CEO.",

  "openQuestions": [
    "What is the internal AI/ML team structure within product divisions?",
    "How is the OpenAI partnership structured operationally?",
    "What specific AI/ML talent pipeline and hiring practices does Anduril use?",
    "How does Lattice platform governance work across product lines?",
    "What are the specific AI R&D budget allocations vs. manufacturing/production?"
  ],

  "conferenceFindings": "No dedicated AI/tech conference presence found - Luckey primarily speaks at defense, business, and general tech venues (TED, Abundance Summit, a16z Founders Summit, Shawn Ryan Show). The AI Grand Prix (Fall 2026) represents a novel approach to recruiting AI talent through competition rather than traditional conference presence.",

  "specimenRecommendation": {
    "shouldCreateSpecimen": true,
    "rationale": "Anduril is the paradigm case of M9 AI-Native in defense. High quotability from Luckey, clear structural model, rich data on investments and products. Essential for any discussion of born-AI organizations.",
    "taxonomyFit": "Perfect fit for M9 AI-Native. The company literally did not exist before AI - it was founded to apply AI to defense, not to add AI to an existing defense business."
