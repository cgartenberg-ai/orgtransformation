However, search results confirm the structural picture: Genentech Innovation Center Boston (at Harvard), the NVIDIA collaboration, and the massive $12B Recursion partnership. Aviv Regev's 'lab in a loop' concept remains the most distinctive AI integration framing in pharma. The Q4 earnings call transcript was behind SeekingAlpha paywall. The M3 classification (AI-native R&D subsidiary) is supported by the structural separation between Genentech's AI-first research and Roche's broader pharma/diagnostics operations."
