    "rationale": "Nike has a dedicated Chief Data and AI Officer (Alan John) running a central data/AI/cloud function, but AI is also deeply embedded across the organization — in supply chain (now under COO), in the Nike Sport Research Lab, and in consumer-facing applications. The December 2025 restructuring eliminated the CTO role and moved tech under the COO, suggesting a shift toward operational integration rather than standalone tech leadership. The emphasis on 'embedding digital, data and AI across the business' points to a contextual orientation where AI is infused throughout rather than siloed.",
    "aiTeamStructure": "Central Data & AI team led by Alan John (Global VP, Chief Data and AI Officer) responsible for AI innovation strategy, data platform modernization, and cloud infrastructure. The team enables hyper-personalized consumer experiences, operational intelligence, and digital growth at scale. John has reportedly led teams of 50 to 2,000+ globally. The Nike Sport Research Lab (NSRL) is a separate, specialized research facility focused on athlete performance, using AI for motion capture analysis and product design. As of December 2025, technology oversight moved under the new COO (Venky Alagirisamy), eliminating the standalone CTO role.",

  "summary": "Nike has a dedicated Chief Data and AI Officer (Alan John) but operates with a contextual/hybrid model where AI is embedded across operations, supply chain, and the Nike Sport Research Lab rather than concentrated in a standalone AI lab. The December 2025 restructuring eliminated the CTO role and moved technology under the new COO, signaling a shift toward operational integration. The departure of the VP of AI/ML Engineering in 2025 and the organizational changes suggest Nike is in a transitional period for its AI leadership structure.",

  "openQuestions": [
    "Where does Alan John (CDAIO) report — to the COO, CEO, or elsewhere after the Dec 2025 restructuring?",
    "What is the size of Nike's central Data & AI team?",
    "What happened to the 'Transformational Generative AI Initiative' after Loveland's departure?",
    "Does Nike have explicit AI budget or R&D allocation metrics?",
    "How does AI work in NSRL coordinate with the central Data & AI team?"
  ],

  "conferenceFindings": "No conference presence identified. Elliott Hill has not appeared at major AI/tech conferences. Nike executives have not presented at AI-focused events in recent years based on available sources.",

  "leadershipTransition": {
    "context": "Elliott Hill became CEO in October 2024 after John Donahoe's departure. Hill is a Nike lifer (intern to CEO) focused on returning to sport/athlete roots rather than digital-first strategy.",
    "implications": "Hill's emphasis on 'agile, tech-enabled Nike' but reluctance to 'talk about structure' suggests AI is viewed as an enabler rather than a strategic differentiator. The CTO elimination may indicate de-prioritization of standalone tech leadership in favor of operational integration."
