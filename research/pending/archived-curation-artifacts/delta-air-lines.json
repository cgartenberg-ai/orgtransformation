The Innovation Hubs (The Hangar, Sustainable Skies Lab) serve as ideation centers. CEO Bastian emphasizes 'augmented intelligence' empowering frontline teams, which suggests contextual ambidexterity where individuals balance exploration and execution within roles. No dedicated research lab for pure AI exploration; instead, applied AI across functions.",

Key units: (1) The Hangar - global innovation center in Atlanta's Tech Square for design ideation and rapid prototyping; (2) Delta Sustainable Skies Lab - focus on sustainable aviation tech with university and industry partnerships; (3) TechOps AI initiatives for predictive maintenance and drone inspections; (4) Software Engineering team handles customer-facing AI (Delta Concierge, pricing).

  "summary": "Delta Air Lines operates a Hybrid/Hub-and-Spoke AI model with central standards set by the Enterprise Data & AI organization under the CDTO, while implementation is distributed across operational domains (TechOps, pricing, customer experience). CEO Ed Bastian has positioned himself as a visible AI evangelist, framing AI as 'augmented intelligence' that empowers frontline workers rather than replaces them. Delta invested $500M in cloud migration as the AI foundation and is rolling out applied AI incrementally (1% of pricing currently AI-driven, Delta Concierge in beta).",
