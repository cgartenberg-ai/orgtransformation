  "summary": "Mercedes-Benz operates a sophisticated hub-and-spoke AI structure with MBRDNA in Silicon Valley as its self-designated 'global AI center' (600+ employees) and the Berlin Digital Factory Campus as its manufacturing AI hub. The May 2025 appointment of Daniel Eitler as the first Chief Data & AI Officer signals formal centralization of AI governance. CEO Källenius has framed AI as the redefinition of luxury, declaring 'every Mercedes will have a supercomputer in it,' while investing 'double-digit billion euros per year' in R&D. The proprietary MB.OS platform centralizes architectural standards while enabling distributed execution across global tech hubs in Germany, China, India, Israel, and North America.",

  "openQuestions": [
    "Exact headcount of AI-focused engineers globally (only MBRDNA's 600+ is specified)",
    "Organizational relationship between CDAIO Daniel Eitler and CSO Magnus Östberg - do they share AI responsibility?",
    "Budget allocation specifically for AI vs. broader software/R&D",
    "Status of CES 2026 Alpamayo 1 VLA (Vision-Language-Action) model - no details found in search results",
    "Specific team structure and leadership within MBRDNA's AI organization",
    "Decision-making process between central AI governance and regional hubs (especially China)",
    "Whether the 'Global Cyber Security, Data and AI' umbrella includes product AI (MB.OS) or only enterprise AI"
  ],

  "conferenceFindings": "No specific details found about the CES 2026 Alpamayo 1 VLA model mentioned in the scan context. Search results focused on MB.OS, Google Gemini/ChatGPT integration, and the 2026 CLA launch. The VLA model may be a pre-announcement or less publicized development. Would benefit from searching specifically for 'Alpamayo' or Mercedes CES 2026 keynote coverage."
