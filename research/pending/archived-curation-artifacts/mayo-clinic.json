The Mayo Clinic Platform serves as an additional hub for external innovation and partnerships. Multiple distinct units handle different aspects: Department of AI & Informatics (research), Center for Digital Health (transformation), Mayo Clinic Platform (external innovation/commercialization). Strong structural ambidexterity with separation between exploration (Platform, research lab) and execution (clinical AI deployment).",

Clinical AI is embedded in departments (Neurology, Pathology, Radiology, Cardiovascular). An 'AI Factory' approach launched in 2021 standardizes development processes across 200+ use cases.",

  "summary": "Mayo Clinic operates a sophisticated Hybrid/Hub-and-Spoke model with multiple specialized hubs: a CAIO (Tripathi) for implementation governance, a CDAO (Sehgal) for AI enablement and the 'AI Factory,' and Mayo Clinic Platform (Halamka) for external innovation and commercialization. AI execution is distributed across clinical departments led by physician-scientists. The organization demonstrates strong structural ambidexterity—separating exploration (Platform, research) from execution (clinical deployment)—with $9B infrastructure investment and 320+ algorithms in production. As a nonprofit, Mayo frames AI in service-mission terms ('the needs of the patient come first') rather than shareholder value.",

  "openQuestions": [
    "Exact size of centralized AI teams vs. embedded clinical AI staff",
    "Specific budget allocation to AI vs. overall R&D spending",
    "Governance relationship between CAIO and CDAO roles—how do they coordinate?",
    "Details on the 'AI Factory' operating model and cycle time for use case development",
    "Multi-agentic AI initiative mentioned at HIMSS 2026—specifics not yet found",
    "Google Cloud partnership (announced 2019)—current status and outcomes"
  ],

  "conferenceFindings": "Strong presence at AI/healthcare conferences. Farrugia keynoted HIMSS22 on healthcare transformation and participated in WEF 2025's 'Fixing Healthcare, Digitally' panel discussing agentic AI and assurance labs. Reference to HIMSS 2026 multi-agentic AI initiative in target context, but no detailed findings on that specific presentation yet. Mayo hosts its own annual AI Summit. Farrugia also keynoted the 10th Annual Individualizing Medicine Conference on AI/genomics integration."
