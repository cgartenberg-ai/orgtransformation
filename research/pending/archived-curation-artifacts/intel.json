The recent flattening under Tan shows a central hub (CEO directly leading AI strategy after CTO departure to OpenAI) with distributed execution in product groups. The Central Engineering Group was established to unify horizontal functions. Intel Labs + University Centers of Excellence represent exploration, while product groups execute. This is classic hub-and-spoke.",

  "summary": "Intel operates a Hybrid/Hub-and-Spoke model with Intel Labs (700+ researchers) handling fundamental AI research while product groups (CCG, DCAI, custom ASIC) execute AI products. CEO Lip-Bu Tan has flattened the organization and now directly leads AI strategy after CTO Sachin Katti's departure to OpenAI. The turnaround emphasizes becoming 'engineering-focused,' eliminating bureaucracy, and catching up in datacenter AI where Intel has fallen behind NVIDIA.",

  "openQuestions": [
    "How is AI research prioritization decided between Intel Labs and product groups?",
    "What is the specific headcount of the AI and Advanced Technologies Group?",
    "How will the NVIDIA partnership change internal AI chip development strategy?",
    "Who will be named as permanent CTO/CAIO after Katti's departure?",
    "What is the governance structure for Intel's university AI Centers of Excellence?"
  ],

  "conferenceFindings": "Lip-Bu Tan delivered opening keynote at Intel Vision 2025 (March 31, 2025) - his first major public presentation as CEO. Key themes: honest acknowledgment of competitive struggles ('We fell behind on innovation'), commitment to engineering-focused culture, anti-bureaucracy messaging. Also spoke at Intel Foundry Direct Connect about 18A yields and foundry turnaround."
