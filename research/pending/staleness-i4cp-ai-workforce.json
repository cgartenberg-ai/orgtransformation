  "summary": "First scan of i4cp. Their 2026 Priorities Report represents comprehensive survey of CHROs and HR executives on AI-driven workforce transformation. Key findings: 80% of Future of Work leaders prioritizing work redesign for AI, 70% reimagining org design from job-based to task-based models, 68% of CHROs focused on AI workforce initiatives. Notable structural mechanisms include work deconstruction (breaking roles into tasks for AI/human allocation), internal talent marketplaces, and treating agentic AI like 'interns requiring supervision'. The HR function itself is evolving from three-pillar model to 'intelligence-driven ecosystem.' Only 12% of orgs mature in skills-based models despite being seen as future direction.",
