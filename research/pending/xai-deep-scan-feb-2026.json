      "claim": "Grateful to have helped cofound at the start. And enormous thanks to Elon Musk... It's time to recalibrate my gradient on the big picture.",
      "context": "Departure post on X, announcing last day at xAI",
      "rhetoricalFunction": "Uses machine learning metaphor ('recalibrate my gradient') to frame departure as a personal optimization rather than organizational failure. Maintains gratitude toward Musk, suggesting a managed departure rather than acrimonious split. The 'big picture' framing implies xAI has become too narrow or execution-focused for a research-oriented founder.",

      "rhetoricalFunction": "Commodification critique — frames AI lab work as undifferentiated, reducing the appeal of frontier research. Challenges the organizational purpose claim that xAI is doing something unique. This is a researcher's statement that the exploration phase is over and the field has entered execution/scaling mode.",
