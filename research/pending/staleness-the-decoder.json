  "summary": "First scan of The Decoder. Found 3 HIGH-relevance organizational findings: (1) Amazon creating dedicated AI Studio unit for film/TV production - structural response to AI capabilities; (2) OpenAI/Microsoft framing 2026 as 'users are the bottleneck' - capability exceeds organizational deployment capacity, enterprise plans to $20K/month; (3) Amodei/Hassabis both report already reducing junior hiring at Anthropic/DeepMind, predict major entry-level job displacement. Key theme: AI leaders publicly acknowledging organizational restructuring already underway."
