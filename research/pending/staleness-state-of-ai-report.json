  "summary": "First scan of this source. State of AI Report 2025 (stateof.ai) provides enterprise adoption stats - 44% of US businesses paying for AI tools is notable. The more valuable find is Deloitte's State of AI in Enterprise 2026 (published Sept 2025) with strong organizational findings: governance gap for agentic AI (only 20% have mature models), skills gap as top barrier, and a revealing disconnect where companies feel prepared on strategy but less prepared on infrastructure/talent/risk. The education-over-restructuring finding aligns with our specimen observations about training investments.",

  "notes": "The Deloitte report (n=3,235 senior leaders) is methodologically stronger than most industry reports. The agentic AI governance gap is highly relevant to our specimen collection - could add as a field signal. The strategy-capability disconnect echoes patterns we see in specimens that announce AI initiatives but struggle with execution."
