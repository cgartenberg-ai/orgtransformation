Beth Galetti (SVP People Experience) framed differently: 'we've been working to strengthen our organization by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy.' However, Galetti also characterized the restructuring as adjustment to AI's 'transformative technology' — contradicting Jassy's insistence that AI wasn't the primary driver. Earlier June 2025 Jassy memo explicitly cited AI efficiency gains as necessitating workforce reductions.",

Suleyman has unveiled a dedicated Microsoft AI Superintelligence Team focused on building systems that can 'eventually outperform humans across all tasks while maintaining strict safety protocols.' He defines the target as 'professional-grade AGI' — capable of performing most tasks typical professionals handle daily. He emphasizes 'containment' and human oversight as priorities.
