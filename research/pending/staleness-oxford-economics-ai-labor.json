  "summary": "First scan of Oxford Economics AI/labor research. Major January 2026 research briefing challenges AI job displacement narrative — finds only 4.5% of US job losses attributed to AI, suggests companies use AI as 'cover story' for routine layoffs. Key organizational insight: the productivity test (if AI were displacing workers, productivity should accelerate — it isn't). February 2026 outlook predicts 'jobless expansion' where growth comes from AI-enabled productivity gains rather than hiring. Relevant to structural research: evidence that AI workforce transformation is slower than corporate narratives suggest, with firms in 'low-hire, low-fire' equilibrium.",
