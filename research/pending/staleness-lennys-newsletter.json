  "summary": "First scan of Lenny's Newsletter yields exceptional AI-organizational content. Three HIGH-relevance findings: (1) SaaStr replaced 10-person sales team with 20 AI agents managed by 1.2 humans; (2) Lovable reached $200M ARR with 100 employees, shifting activation to product teams and re-finding PMF every 3 months; (3) Vercel replaced 10 SDRs with 1 person + AI, pioneering 'GTM engineer' hybrid role. Strong signal that sales/GTM functions are rapidly restructuring around AI agents. Lovable and Vercel are both candidate specimens. SaaStr findings provide macro-level evidence of AI-driven role elimination in sales."
