  "summary": "Major regulatory developments since Aug 2025: SEC created internal AI Task Force with CAIO role (structural parallel to corporate trends we track). December 2025 recommendations push toward requiring companies to disclose AI governance structures, map AI use across business functions, and distinguish internal vs customer-facing AI. FY2026 examination priorities specifically target AI capability claims accuracy. This creates compliance pressure that will force more detailed AI organizational disclosure in upcoming 10-K filings. Key insight: SEC's own structural response (CAIO, cross-agency task force) mirrors corporate patterns we're documenting.",
