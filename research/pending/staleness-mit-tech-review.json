Key organizational findings: (1) Only 2% of execs rate AI results highly; 7% have scaled genAI widely despite 66% having deployed somewhere—scaling gap confirmed. (2) AI writing 25-30% of code at Microsoft/Google—major workforce integration signal. (3) 98% companies feel urgency, 85% believe <18 months to deploy or face negative effects—time pressure driving structural decisions. (4) Mistral AI 'iconic use case' methodology: strategic, urgent, impactful, feasible criteria for AI transformation starting point. (5) Vanguard research: AI as 'augmentation not displacement' GPT framing.",
