  "summary": "Major new content: Deloitte's 8th annual State of AI in the Enterprise (3,235 respondents, 24 countries) provides critical cross-cutting data on enterprise AI maturity. KEY STRUCTURAL FINDINGS: (1) Severe governance gap—only 21% have mature agent governance despite 73% planning agentic deployment; (2) Organizational inertia—84% haven't redesigned jobs despite 82% expecting automation; (3) Pilot purgatory—only 25% have moved 40%+ pilots to production; (4) Process redesign lag—only 30% redesigning processes, 37% doing surface-level integration; (5) Workforce access expansion—50% increase in sanctioned AI tool access in one year. CrewAI survey adds agentic-specific data: 65% already using agents, 31% of workflows automated. This source was mislabeled as openai.com—it's actually Deloitte's enterprise survey.",
