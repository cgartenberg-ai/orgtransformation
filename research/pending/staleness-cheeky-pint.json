HIGH-relevance Musk episode contains xAI organizational structure insights: framing AI work as engineering not research, team of several hundred engineers, critique of 'AI labs' as revenue-maximizing corporations. Ben Thompson episode covers AI agents disrupting business models. Julia DeWahl episode addresses AI infrastructure constraints (nuclear for hyperscalers).",
  "actionRequired": true,
  "recommendedAction": "Queue Musk episode for detailed curation - xAI organizational structure is directly relevant to specimen collection. Ben Thompson episode may yield Meta organizational insights worth cross-referencing with existing Meta specimen."
