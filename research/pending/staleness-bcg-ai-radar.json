  "summary": "First scan of BCG AI Radar. The January 2026 edition (surveying 2,360 executives including 640 CEOs) reveals a major governance shift: AI strategy has moved from IT-led to CEO-led, with 72% of CEOs now serving as chief AI decision makers. Three CEO archetypes emerge (Pioneers, Pragmatists, Followers) with stark differences in upskilling investment (60% vs 24-27% of AI budget). Investment is doubling despite uncertain ROI. Key tension: 90% expect agent ROI but 60% are intentionally slowing implementation due to error concerns. The 'silicon ceiling' finding (only 50% frontline adoption) highlights execution gaps. Multiple high-relevance articles for our research on organizational structure.",
