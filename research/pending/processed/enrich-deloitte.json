    "teamStructure": "Deloitte is implementing a major talent architecture overhaul effective June 1, 2026. Traditional pyramid titles (analyst, consultant, manager) are being replaced with role-specific designations referencing 'job family' and 'sub-family' (e.g., 'Software Engineer III', 'Project Management Senior Consultant', 'Senior Consultant, Functional Transformation'). Internally, employees will be assigned alphanumeric levels (L45 = senior consultant, L55 = manager). A new 'Leaders' class joins partners, principals, and managing directors. This restructuring affects approximately 181,500 US employees and reflects AI's reshaping of consulting work, as Deloitte invests $3B in GenAI through FY2030.",

      "metrics": "85% of surveyed companies plan to customize autonomous AI agents. Only 34% report using AI to 'deeply transform' operations. 25% have moved 40%+ of pilots to production. 30% redesigning core processes around AI. 21% have mature agentic AI governance frameworks."
    },
    "classificationUpdate": "Current classification is M? with Low confidence. Based on new data, Deloitte appears to be a hybrid structure combining: (1) Dedicated AI leadership (Global AI Leader, US Head of AI, regional CAIOs, AI Institutes), (2) Centers of Excellence (Global AI Infrastructure CoE, APAC Agentic AI CoE), and (3) Broad organizational embedding (470K employees with AI tools access expanding from 40% to 60%). This suggests M8 (Hub-and-Spoke) or a variant of M2 (Embedded) with centralized CoE coordination. Recommend upgrading to M8 with Medium confidence pending verification of reporting relationships between CoEs, AI Leaders, and business units."

  "summary": "Deloitte has named AI leadership positions (Nitin Mittal as Global AI Leader, Jim Rowan as US Head of AI, regional CAIOs like Sulabh Soral), committed $3B to GenAI through FY2030, and is restructuring its 181,500 US workforce away from the traditional consulting pyramid toward role-specific titles with alphanumeric levels (effective June 2026). The firm has launched multiple Centers of Excellence including a Global AI Infrastructure CoE and an Asia Pacific Agentic AI CoE with 120+ AI specialists.",

  "openQuestions": [
    "Exact reporting relationship between Global AI Leader (Mittal), US Head of AI (Rowan), and regional CAIOs (Soral)",
    "Whether the AI Institutes and CoEs share a unified governance structure or operate independently",
    "Total global AI headcount across all regions and business units",
    "What percentage of the $3B GenAI investment has been deployed vs. committed"
  ],

  "botanistNotes": [
    "The June 2026 talent architecture overhaul is highly significant — Deloitte is explicitly citing AI as the driver for abandoning the traditional consulting pyramid model. This is one of the clearest signals of AI reshaping organizational structure in professional services.",
    "The layered AI leadership structure (Global AI Leader → US/regional heads → regional CAIOs → CoEs → AI Institutes) suggests a Hub-and-Spoke model (M8) rather than pure embedded or centralized approaches. The CoEs appear to provide shared infrastructure while business units retain delivery.",
    "The 'coupling of people and machine intelligence' framing from Mittal signals an integration-first philosophy rather than replacement or siloed AI teams — aligns with contextual ambidexterity patterns."
