    "investmentSignals": "Q3 2025: Revenue $271.7M (41% YoY growth), net income $292.2M (includes $222.7M tax benefit). Gross margin 72.5% — slightly down due to higher AI and hosting costs. Guiding to ~$1.2B bookings for year (33% growth). 29% adjusted EBITDA margin. No specific AI budget disclosed, but von Ahn noted 'costs are coming down' for AI features. Most expensive AI features are behind Duolingo Max paywall. 38% profit growth in Q1 2025.",
    "recentDevelopments": "April 2025: Von Ahn published 'AI-first' memo on LinkedIn declaring company AI-first. Significant backlash followed; he later clarified 'I do not see AI as replacing what our employees do.' Company reduced 10% of contractors citing AI capabilities. No full-time employees laid off (company claims never to have laid off full-time employees since founding in 2009). Added headcount since April 2025. 2025: Launched 'Video Call With Lily' — AI character for real-world speaking practice. Doubled language course offerings to 148+ courses using AI-assisted content generation. Chess course launched (fastest-growing course). July 2025: Von Ahn joined Figma board. Late 2025: Von Ahn announced as recipient of 2026 IEEE Frances E. Allen Medal.",
    "observableMarkers": {
      "reportingStructure": "Head of AI (Klinton Bicknell) exists but no CAIO/CDO. AI strategy driven directly by CEO Luis von Ahn. CTO Severin Hacker (co-founder) leads technical vision including AI. No separate AI executive reporting to board.",
      "resourceAllocation": "Engineering 347 employees (40.6% of workforce). Total 855 employees. 83 new hires YTD vs 45 departures = net +38. Pittsburgh HQ: 289. New York: 187. Remote/distributed: 279. Higher AI/hosting costs noted in earnings but specific AI headcount not disclosed.",
      "timeHorizons": "frAI-days (Friday mornings) for weekly AI experimentation. Daily Birdbrain model updates. Longer-term vision: become 'as good as a one-on-one tutor.' 2026 guidance to be provided February 2026.",
      "decisionRights": "Hiring decisions now require demonstrating work 'cannot be replaced by AI or made significantly more efficient through AI.' AI usage factored into performance reviews. Teams must justify headcount by showing they cannot automate more work.",
      "metrics": "130M monthly active users. 36% DAU growth YoY. Q3 2025: $271.7M revenue. Productivity claim: 'same number of people can make 4-5x as much content.' User engagement: doubled average words spoken per Max subscriber in 2025."
    },
    "classificationUpdate": "Current classification as M? (Contextual orientation) appears correct. Duolingo represents a contextual approach — AI is integrated across the organization rather than isolated in a separate unit. The frAI-days initiative, the policy of requiring all teams to demonstrate AI-augmented work, and the absence of a separate 'AI division' all support contextual orientation. Could potentially be classified as M8 (AI-Native Upstart) given that Birdbrain AI has been core since 2018 and the company was AI-enabled from early stage. Recommend reviewing whether M8 fits better than current M? classification."

  "summary": "Substantial new structural data obtained. Duolingo has 855 employees with Engineering comprising 347 (40.6%) — the largest department. Key AI leadership identified: Klinton Bicknell as Head of AI (since 2018), with Burr Settles as former director of research. The April 2025 'AI-first' memo created significant backlash but company claims no full-time layoffs ever; only 10% contractor reduction. Novel organizational feature: 'frAI-days' (Friday mornings) for company-wide AI experimentation.",

  "openQuestions": [
    "Exact size of dedicated AI research team (beyond knowing engineering is 347)",
    "Does Klinton Bicknell still hold Head of AI title as of 2026?",
    "What is Burr Settles' current role (left or reassigned)?",
    "Specific R&D/AI budget allocation as % of revenue",
    "Reporting line for Head of AI — does Bicknell report to CTO Hacker or CEO von Ahn?"
  ],

  "botanistNotes": [
    "The 'frAI-days' initiative is a distinctive observable marker — weekly protected time for AI experimentation across the entire organization, not just technical teams. This is a strong signal of contextual orientation.",
    "The backlash-then-clarification cycle around the AI-first memo reveals tension: leadership wants aggressive AI adoption, but public messaging requires careful framing. Von Ahn's quote 'Every tech company is doing similar things, we were open about it' suggests transparency as differentiator — possibly a specimen for studying how organizations manage AI narratives.",
    "Classification question: Is this M8 (AI-Native Upstart) or truly contextual? Birdbrain predates the AI hype (2018), suggesting AI was foundational rather than transformational. The 4-5x productivity claim and content scaling via AI suggests the organization was built around AI leverage from early stage."
