    "rationale": "AstraZeneca operates a federated model with a central enterprise data office (led by CDO Brian Dummann) that sets standards, tools, and policies, while distributed data offices in business units retain autonomy to pursue their own AI projects. The AI Accelerator serves as a cross-functional enablement layer. They explicitly state 'there is no central group that determines what projects we will or won't do' — business leaders decide within guardrails. This is classic hub-and-spoke: central standards + distributed execution.",

The CDO leads a team focused on 'accelerating the impact of technology, data, and AI across AstraZeneca's value chain.' No CAIO — AI governance is deliberately integrated within data governance rather than standalone. Key structural element is the 'AI Accelerator,' a cross-functional initiative bringing together technology, legal, compliance, and governance teams to streamline assessments and accelerate implementation.",

  "summary": "AstraZeneca operates a federated hub-and-spoke model for AI: a central enterprise data office under CDO Brian Dummann sets standards and governance, while business units retain full autonomy to decide which AI projects to pursue. The 'AI Accelerator' cross-functional initiative speeds implementation by unifying legal, compliance, and tech reviews. AI is deeply embedded in R&D (2x faster drug discovery, antibody leads in 3 days vs 3 months) with $13B annual R&D and $2.5B committed to a new Beijing AI lab.",

  "openQuestions": [
    "Size of dedicated AI/data science headcount across the federated structure",
    "How the Modella AI acquisition (Q4 2025) changes oncology R&D AI structure",
    "Whether the Beijing AI lab represents a shift toward more centralized research AI",
    "Specific governance mechanisms for high-risk AI applications mentioned but not detailed"
  ],

  "conferenceFindings": "No known AI-specific conference presence identified. Pascal Soriot has done Morgan Stanley and CNBC interviews discussing AI but no major AI/tech conference keynotes found.",

  "botanistNotes": [
    "AstraZeneca's explicit rejection of a CAIO role is structurally interesting — they deliberately integrated AI governance within data governance, arguing the capabilities and processes are the same. This challenges the emerging norm of standalone AI leadership.",
    "The federated model with 'no central group that determines what projects we will or won't do' is unusual for pharma, which typically requires tight R&D coordination. They've solved this by separating standards (central) from project selection (distributed).",
    "The 'AI Accelerator' as a cross-functional initiative (tech + legal + compliance + governance) rather than a team is a different structural choice than the typical Center of Excellence — it's a coordination mechanism, not an org unit.",
    "The CDO role here is much broader than typical data roles — Dummann owns AI strategy, governance, and implementation across the entire value chain. This is closer to a CDAIO than a traditional CDO."
  ],

  "bestQuote": {
    "text": "There is no central group that determines what projects we will or won't do.",
    "speaker": "Brian Dummann",
    "why": "This single quote captures AstraZeneca's unusual structural philosophy: extreme decentralization of AI decision rights within strong central guardrails. In pharma — where R&D coordination is typically centralized — this is a provocative stance that reveals a bet on distributed innovation over central optimization."
