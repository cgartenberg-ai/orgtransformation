    "classificationUpdate": "Current M? classification should be updated. The specimen shows MULTIPLE structural models: (1) Platform-to-Product model (commercializing Route Optimization as SaaS) remains valid, but (2) there's also strong evidence of an Embedded AI model with dedicated AI leadership (Danker, Vasudev, Kumar) and centralized AI platforms (Element MLOps, super agents). Consider hybrid M3-M5 or reclassify based on dominant pattern. The centralized AI platform team with embedded deployment ('super agents' managing specialized agents) suggests M5 (Embedded AI) may be more accurate than pure Platform-to-Product."

  "summary": "Substantial new structural data found. Walmart has built dedicated AI leadership: Daniel Danker (EVP AI Acceleration) reports to Suresh Kumar (Global CTO), with Hari Vasudev driving agentic AI strategy and Sravana Karnati overseeing the Element MLOps platform. January 2026 restructuring centralizes platforms under a global Chief Growth Officer while operational segments report to new CEO John Furner. The company invested $500M+ in AI/robotics while cutting 1,500 corporate roles, targeting 65% store automation and keeping 2.1M global headcount flat for 3+ years.",

  "openQuestions": [
    "Exact headcount of dedicated AI/ML teams (not disclosed)",
    "Budget allocation specifically for AI vs. broader technology spend",
    "How Element MLOps platform teams are organized internally",
    "Whether Route Optimization commercialization (Walmart Commerce Technologies) is still a major focus or overshadowed by broader AI initiatives"
  ],

  "botanistNotes": [
    "STRUCTURAL SIGNAL: The January 2026 restructuring reveals a 'platform centralization + federated operations' model. Furner's quote about 'centralizing platforms to accelerate shared capabilities' while 'freeing up operating segments' is a classic ambidexterity move - build once centrally, deploy contextually.",
    "CLASSIFICATION TENSION: Original specimen focused on Platform-to-Product (Route Optimization). New data shows this is ONE piece of a much larger story. The dominant pattern now appears to be Embedded AI (M5) with dedicated leadership (Danker, Vasudev, Kumar), proprietary platforms (Element, Wallaby), and 'super agents' architecture. Platform-to-Product commercialization continues but isn't the primary structural model.",
    "REMARKABLE: The 'surgical agentic AI' philosophy (Vasudev) contrasts with many competitors' broad horizontal deployments. Walmart is building specialized agents for specific tasks that 'stitch together' - an architecturally mature approach suggesting a well-developed AI operating model rather than exploratory experiments."
