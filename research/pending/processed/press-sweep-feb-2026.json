      "trend": "AI-Washing vs. Genuine AI Restructuring",
      "description": "A major debate has emerged around whether companies citing AI as justification for layoffs are genuinely restructuring for AI capabilities or using AI as cover for standard cost-cutting. Forrester Research coined the term 'AI-washing.' Of 1.2M US job cuts in 2025, only 55,000 (4.5%) were directly attributed to AI per Challenger, Gray & Christmas. An HBR study found 60% of orgs made headcount reductions in ANTICIPATION of AI, while only 2% based cuts on actual AI implementation results. This anticipation-vs-evidence gap is a major structural finding.",
      "analyticalImplication": "This trend directly challenges our field observations. We need to distinguish between: (a) genuine structural transformation (Amazon's deliberate management layer elimination, Salesforce's support function halving), (b) anticipatory restructuring based on expected AI capabilities, and (c) AI-washing where AI is a convenient narrative for standard cost-cutting. Each has different structural implications.",

Glassdoor research identifies 'forever layoffs' as a distinct phenomenon where successive waves compound engagement damage more than single reductions.
