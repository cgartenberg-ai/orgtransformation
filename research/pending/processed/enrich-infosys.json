    "classificationUpdate": "Current classification as M? (unknown model) should be updated. Evidence suggests M4 (Dedicated AI Unit) or potentially M6 (Portfolio of Units).

The multi-lab structure with central platform suggests M6 Portfolio orientation, but could also be M4 with strong platform governance."

  "summary": "Significant enrichment achieved. Identified two key AI leadership roles (Sunil Senan as Global Head of Data and AI, Bali DR as EVP for AI and Industry Verticals) - no dedicated CAIO. Found $500M innovation fund, three-wave AI adoption strategy, and impressive scale metrics: 4,600 active AI projects, 28M lines of AI-generated code, 500+ agents built, 270K employees AI-certified. Multiple new partnerships (Cognition/Devin, Cambridge AI Lab) add to Cursor CoE already documented.",

  "openQuestions": [
    "Exact reporting relationship between Sunil Senan and Bali DR - are they peers or is there hierarchy?",
    "What percentage of the $500M innovation fund is allocated specifically to AI vs other initiatives?",
    "Specific headcount for the Topaz team or AI-dedicated employees (as opposed to AI-trained)"
  ],

  "botanistNotes": [
    "The dual-leadership structure (Senan for Data/AI strategy, Bali for AI adoption/service lines) suggests a matrix model - one leader for capability, one for deployment. This is a common but sophisticated pattern for scaling AI across a 300K+ workforce.",
    "The three-wave adoption timeline is revealing: they're explicitly in 'Wave 2' (IT ops, business processes) with 'Wave 3' (process improvement) 6-12 months out. This suggests measured, portfolio-style rollout rather than moonshot thinking.",
    "The 12,506 headcount reduction over two years alongside 20K planned FY27 hires signals workforce recomposition, not contraction. They're replacing traditional roles with AI-augmented ones - the Parekh quote about 'people working with software agents' confirms this strategic intent."
