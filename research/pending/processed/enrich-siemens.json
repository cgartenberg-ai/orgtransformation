  "summary": "Significant new structural detail found: Philomin reports to CTO Peter Koerte (not directly to CEO), establishing a CTO-reporting AI model. Major investments confirmed: €9.5B Altair + $5.1B Dotmatics acquisitions, >€2.5B quarterly AI software orders. ONE Tech Company transformation has concrete timeline (October 2026 major changes, 2-year scaling). Data-sharing alliances with Trumpf and DMG Mori for industrial model training add specificity to the 'industrial AI models' approach.",

  "openQuestions": [
    "Exact headcount of central Data & AI organization under Philomin",
    "Percentage of R&D budget allocated specifically to AI",
    "How the 'hundreds of industrial AI experts' committed to NVIDIA partnership are organized",
    "Whether Philomin's team is a new organization or absorbed existing AI teams"
  ],

  "botanistNotes": [
    "The CTO-reporting model (Philomin → Koerte → Busch) suggests AI is positioned as a technology/platform capability rather than a business transformation function. This contrasts with CEO-reporting CAIO models seen at other specimens.",
    "Busch's 'AI doesn't respect silos' quote directly ties the ONE Tech Company transformation to AI implementation needs—the organizational change is explicitly AI-driven, not the reverse.",
    "The 60-70% → 95% accuracy journey through domain-specific training reveals why industrial AI requires different organizational arrangements than consumer AI—the tolerance for error is fundamentally different."
