    "recentDevelopments": "February 2026: 9,000 employee (11%) workforce reduction announced targeting $1.25B annualized savings through 2026. ~5,000 cuts in Denmark. Company described as 'too complex and must be simplified.' Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen stepped down as CEO in August 2025, succeeded by Maziar Mike Doustdar. January 2025: Expanded collaboration with Valo Health for AI-driven obesity/T2D drug development. London AI hub opened Q1 2024. Anja Leth Zimmer appointed CAIO (announcement ~late January 2026).",

      "timeHorizons": "Long-horizon: Drug discovery AI via London hub, DCAI/Gefion supercomputer partnership, Broad Institute genomics research, Valo Health collaboration.

      "decisionRights": "Enterprise AI organization owns applying AI across entire Novo Nordisk value chain. Central CAIO sets enterprise AI agenda. R&D maintains parallel AI initiatives under CSO. London hub operates semi-autonomously for drug discovery focus.",
      "metrics": "300 Enterprise AI employees (Denmark, US, India). 20,000 employees with Copilot access. ~40 employees at London AI hub. 9,000 employee reduction (~78,000 to ~69,000 total). 10% max annual R&D headcount growth."

    "classificationUpdate": "Classification as hub-and-spoke (M6?) is confirmed by new data. Enterprise AI (300 people) serves as the central hub, with clear spoke relationships to R&D AI initiatives under the CSO, London AI hub for drug discovery, and IT operations for Copilot deployment. The CAIO reporting to EVP Enterprise IT (not CEO) suggests AI is positioned as enterprise capability rather than standalone business function. The workforce reduction and simplification mandate may affect AI organization structure going forward."

  "summary": "Significant leadership change: Anja Leth Zimmer appointed as new CAIO, replacing Mads Einar Krogh Kristensen. The 300-person Enterprise AI organization spans Denmark, US, and India with CAIO reporting to EVP Enterprise IT. Major corporate restructuring underway with 9,000 employee cuts ($1.25B savings target). External AI infrastructure includes London AI hub (~40 employees, drug discovery focus) and Gefion supercomputer access via DCAI partnership.",

  "openQuestions": [
    "What happened to Mads Einar Krogh Kristensen (previous CAIO)?",
    "How will the 9,000-employee restructuring affect the AI organization specifically?",
    "What is the specific budget for the Enterprise AI organization?",
    "Who leads the London AI hub?",
    "What is the relationship between Enterprise AI and R&D AI initiatives under Marcus Schindler?"
  ],

  "botanistNotes": [
    "The CAIO reporting to EVP Enterprise IT (rather than CEO) positions AI as enterprise infrastructure/capability rather than strategic business function. This is a more conservative placement than companies with CAIO on executive committee.",
    "The workforce reduction ('too complex, must be simplified') creates interesting tension with the expanding AI organization. Watch for whether AI headcount grows or shrinks during simplification.",
    "Three distinct AI centers of gravity: Enterprise AI (300 people, productivity/enterprise), London hub (~40 people, drug discovery), and R&D AI under CSO. This is sophisticated hub-and-spoke with multiple specialized spokes rather than single central hub.",
    "The Gefion supercomputer partnership via Novo Nordisk Foundation (not the company itself) represents an unusual 'adjacent organization' pattern for accessing AI compute infrastructure."
