Acquired The Browser Company for nearly $1 billion (per search results) to build AI-native browser for knowledge work. Company maintains target of 25%+ non-GAAP operating margin by FY2027 while investing in AI.",
    "recentDevelopments": "MAJOR: Acquired The Browser Company (Dia browser) to build AI-native browser for enterprise knowledge workers (announced Q1 FY26). Rovo hit 5 million monthly active users as of Q2 FY26 (Feb 2026) - up from 3.5M in Q1 FY26. Teamwork Collection passed 1 million seats sold in less than 9 months. Loom AI editions growing >100% YoY.

      "resourceAllocation": "Teamwork Graph now contains 100+ billion objects. Virtual service agents resolving 22% of requests, returning ~57 hours (1.5 FTE) capacity weekly.

    },
    "classificationUpdate": "Current classification shows 'M?' with medium confidence. Based on new data, this appears to be M6 (AI Platform Team) with Structural orientation: The Teamwork Graph + AI Gateway architecture provides a centralized platform that product teams consume. The new Chief Product AND AI Officer role consolidates this further. Rovo operates as an enterprise-wide AI platform across all products. However, the ML Research team doing foundational work suggests some M7 (Dedicated AI R&D) elements. Recommend M6 with high confidence, possibly M6/M7 hybrid."

  "summary": "Atlassian has dramatically scaled its AI footprint: Rovo hit 5 million MAU by Q2 FY26, up from 3.5M just one quarter earlier. The company is consolidating AI and product leadership under new Chief Product and AI Officer Tamar Yehoshua (joining Nov 2025), signaling strategic importance. The ~$1B Browser Company acquisition aims to capture the AI-native browser market for knowledge workers.",

  "openQuestions": [
    "Exact headcount of ML Research team and Teamwork Lab",
    "Specific AI R&D budget or % of total R&D",
    "Whether Teamwork Lab reports to Sherif Mansour or Tamar Yehoshua",
    "Browser Company integration timeline and team structure",
    "How the multi-model 'AI gateway' architecture is technically staffed"
  ],

  "botanistNotes": [
    "The creation of a combined 'Chief Product AND AI Officer' role (Yehoshua) is structurally significant - it suggests AI is not a separate function but integrated into product. This is different from companies that have a standalone CAIO/Head of AI.",
    "Cannon-Brookes's quote 'as software gets cheaper to build, the roadmap gets longer' is a theoretical claim about induced demand in software development - potentially testable as a mechanism.",
    "The 5M→ rapid scaling of Rovo without disclosed team expansion suggests platform efficiency. The multi-model architecture ('built on purpose') indicates an M6 Platform Team model rather than M3 Shadow AI or M7 R&D Lab."
