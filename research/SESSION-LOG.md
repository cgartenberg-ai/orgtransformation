**Sources Scanned**: Press keyword searches (AI restructuring, CAIO, AI lab, AI CoE, AI layoffs, AI venture studio — Feb 2026), BG2 Pod (feed check — 5 new eps since Dec 23, all triaged), Invest Like the Best (Tier 2 podcast — first scan, triaged through Ep 454), HBR AI (first scan — Jan 29 article), PwC CAIO report (first scan), Mercer Global Talent Trends 2026 (preliminary findings)
**Source Types**: press, podcast, report

**Organizations Found (6)**:
| Org | Status | Key Finding |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| IndoStar Capital Finance | **new** | Indian NBFC re-designated CTO Amit Kothari to CAIO (Jan 20, 2026). New CAIO pipeline: CTO→CAIO. Mandate: embed AI in lending engines, risk frameworks, digital architecture. 28+ yr veteran. |
| NTT DATA | **new** | Triple-CoE structure: OpenAI CoE (external client services), internal AI CoE within CIO office (Maureen Tan), Virtual CoE for CX (launched 2026, Czech/Belgium/Germany). Smart AI Agent ecosystem targeting $2B revenue by 2027. ISG Leader for Agentic AI. |

| UPS | evolution | 48K+ jobs confirmed 2025 (10% of 490K), 20-30K more planned 2026. $9B automation through 2028. Louisville Velocity hub: robots outnumber workers 15:1. **Key structural finding**: targeting management layers specifically — AI reduces coordination complexity, enabling org delayering and region consolidation. |
| Microsoft | evolution | 15K+ jobs cut in 2025 despite $88B AI spend. Nadella: 30% of code now AI-written, 220K employees a "massive disadvantage." Targeting management layers between ICs and senior execs. Feb 23 RTO enforcement called "soft layoff tool." |
| PwC | evolution | CAIO Dan Priest (Toyota CIO → PwC cloud → CAIO). $1B AI investment/3yr. 2026 framework: CAIO evolving from single role to "portfolio of accountable owners." 79% of executives adopting AI agents. |

**Broader Trends**:
- **"AI Potential vs. Performance" Paradox**: HBR (Davenport/Srinivasan, Jan 29): companies restructuring around AI's *potential*, not proven capabilities. BCG: 60% of firms see minimal gains despite substantial investment. Oxford Economics: layoffs fund AI experiments, not replace workers.
- **Mercer GTT 2026**: Employee AI anxiety 28%→40%. 63% C-suite see work redesign as top ROI. 97% of investors penalize firms that don't upskill. Investor pressure now actively shaping AI org design.

- **CAIO Pipeline Diversification**: CTO→CAIO (IndoStar), consumer tech→CAIO (Invent/Zimmerman), enterprise IT→consulting CAIO (PwC/Priest)
- **Multi-CoE Emergence**: NTT DATA operating 3 distinct CoE structures simultaneously — suggests CoE model is fragmenting into specialized variants
