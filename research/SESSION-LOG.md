## 2026-02-04 — Earnings Season Wide-Net Discovery (Q4 2025)

**File**: `sessions/2026-02-04-001-earnings-q4-2025-wide-net.md`

**Sources scanned**: Earnings discovery searches (CAIO, AI restructuring, agentic AI in earnings calls), industry vertical searches (healthcare, insurance, manufacturing, telecom), targeted company follow-ups. Google Q4 and Amazon Q4 transcripts not yet available (calls on Feb 4 and Feb 5).

**Organizations found**:

| Organization | Status | Key Finding |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Travelers (TRV) | **New** | TravAI in-house agentic AI platform, 20K+ active users, Anthropic/Claude partnership for 10K staff, 30% reduction in claims handle time, 4→2 call centers, 65B clean data points, $1.5B tech investment |
| ServiceNow (NOW) | **New** | "AI Control Tower," AI Agent Orchestrator, $600M+ Now Assist revenue, McDermott: "obliterate 20th century org charts," dual Anthropic+OpenAI partnerships, $10B+ in acquisitions (Moveworks, Armis) |
| Accenture (ACN) | Evolution | $865M restructuring, 11K layoffs (791K→779K), "exiting non-reskillable on compressed timeline," 77K AI professionals (up from 40K), 70K trained in agentic AI, $5.9B GenAI bookings |
| Nokia (NOK) | **New** | Agentic AI for network automation (96% downtime reduction), Nokia Defense incubation unit (potential M8 Skunkworks), €750M restructuring, €2.4B from AI/cloud customers |
| Workday (WDAY) | **New** | 1,750 layoffs (8.5%), $230-270M charges — AI-washing data point |

| RWJBarnabas Health | **New** | Healthcare AI CoE spanning 14 hospitals + Rutgers, joint AI Executive Committee |

**Broader trends**:
- **Agentic AI as dominant narrative**: McDermott ("obliterate org charts"), Travelers TravAI, Nokia network automation — "agentic" has replaced "copilot" as the structural framing
- **Insurance as structural AI goldmine**: Travelers is possibly the most operationally detailed non-tech AI deployment — TravAI platform, concrete metrics (30% handle time reduction, 4→2 call centers), deep data moat (65B data points)
- **"Exit the non-reskillable" pattern**: Accenture CEO explicitly framing layoffs as exiting workers who can't be reskilled — structural triage, not just cost-cutting
- **CAIO at critical mass**: IBM data shows 26% of orgs now have CAIO (up from 11%), hub-and-spoke model yields 36% higher ROI
- **Nokia Defense as M8 candidate**: Incubation unit for defense AI — potential first M8 Skunkworks specimen

**New sources**: WebProNews, Insurance Thought Leadership, Roots AI

**Sources updated**: earnings-calls (wide-net discovery session added)

**Follow-ups**: Google Q4 earnings (Feb 4, transcript pending); Amazon Q4 earnings (Feb 5); Travelers deep-scan (TravAI platform deserves dedicated analysis); insurance industry expansion in earnings calendar; Nokia Defense follow-up; Mayo Clinic/Cleveland Clinic structural details

**Broader trends**:
- CapEx arms race: ~$500-530B combined 2026 AI CapEx from 4 companies; market questioning ROI (Microsoft $375B correction)
- Management delayering convergence: Zuckerberg ("single talented person"), Galetti/Amazon ("reducing layers"), prior Nadella statements
- Salesforce as cleanest AI restructuring case: building + using + selling AI-driven restructuring
- Jassy contradiction: "culture not AI" but internal AI agents replacing tasks — AI-washing in real time
- Earnings calls elevated to Tier 1 source — highest structural density
