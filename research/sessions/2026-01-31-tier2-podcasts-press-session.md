## Organizations Observed

---

## Atlassian

### Raw Observations
- Sherif Mansour is Head of AI at Atlassian (~$40B+ market cap)
- 3.5 million users of Atlassian AI capabilities; 70-80+ AI features across main applications
- Proprietary "Teamwork Graph" maps all organizational knowledge: teams, pull requests, work items, Confluence pages, Trello boards, Figma designs, Google docs, dashboards — with relationship mappings and multi-hop traversal
- Graph populates both "organically" (users linking objects) and "inorganically" (system integrations)
- Internal AI structure: product teams building AI features consult a centralized ML team; an "AI gateway" proxy layer manages model selection and routing across multiple providers
- Tiered exploration model: teams get "complete free reign in the early days in discovery" then work with ML team for optimization; different use cases routed to appropriate models (open-source locally-hosted for simple tasks, cloud-based for complex)
- Rovo agents: AI teammates powered by the Teamwork Graph with identity (job description), knowledge access, and autonomous action capability. Library of pre-built agents (project tracking, service, development, content, analytics) plus custom agent creation via no-code or Forge
- At Atlassian Summit '25: announced "Teamwork Collection" (Jira + Confluence + Loom) as integrated AI stack, with Rovo included
- Hiring shift: deliberately altered PM hiring profiles to recruit "AI native" candidates — people who intuitively use AI tools over traditional skill-building. Mansour noted they prefer hiring people "that are cheating in college and university" by using AI tools
- Key framework: "Taste, Knowledge, Workflows" as three essential ingredients for enterprise AI deployment. Taste = organizational character/voice; Knowledge = what info agents access; Workflows = embedding agents in business processes
- Structural insight: shift from "humans as the doers of the work, to one where we are the architects of how the work gets done"

- Hiring "AI-proficient talent" to replace cut roles
- CEO Bill Ready: platform is now "an AI-powered shopping assistant for 600 million customers"
- Pinterest Assistant shopping tool launched Oct 2025

- CEO Jim Fitterling describes it as "radical simplification" — shedding layers of bureaucracy
- Core strategy: integration of advanced automation and AI to handle tasks previously requiring manual oversight
- Uses C3 AI (Palantir-rival) as AI software of choice
- Q4 2025: net loss of $1.5 billion in sluggish packaging/plastics segments

> — Jim Fitterling, CEO, Dow Inc., company announcement, January 29, 2026

### Evolution Flags

- Which specific functions/roles are being automated (production oversight? supply chain? R&D?)
- Will Dow create a dedicated AI unit or CAIO role?

---

## Mercor

### Raw Observations
- AI hiring platform founded 2023 by Brendan Foody (CEO), Adarsh Hiremath (CTO), Surya Midha (Chair) — all dropped out of college, Thiel Fellows
- Explosive growth: $1 to $500M revenue run rate in 17 months
- Oct 2025 Series C: $350M at $10B valuation; backed by Peter Thiel, Jack Dorsey
- Three founders became youngest self-made billionaires in 2025
- Hired 30,000 contractors in 2025 (80% US-based); distributes $1.5M+ daily to contractors
- Customers include OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta — connecting former industry experts (bankers, lawyers, consultants, doctors) with AI labs to create training data evals and rubrics
- Uber's former CPO Sundeep Jain joined as president
- Platform: 20-minute AI interview evaluates skills, creates profile, matches to full-time/part-time/hourly roles
- Jan 2026: launched APEX (AI Productivity Index) measuring AI tool impact on professional productivity
- Foody's structural thesis: AI isn't eliminating labor, it's reallocating it — humans become bottleneck for remaining 10%, creating 10x leverage on human economic output
- Work model shifting toward "more fractional, gig-like" model — Mercor as "Uber for knowledge work"
- Featured on Conversations with Tyler (Oct 16, 2025): youngest guest ever; discussed AI labs needing rubrics, shift toward knowledge workers building RL environments, "nepotism might make a comeback as AI optimizes everyone's cover letters"

### Quotes
> "If AI automates 90% of the economy, then humans become the bottleneck for the remaining 10%. So there's 10x leverage on every unit of economic output that humans contribute because the rest has been automated."
> — Brendan Foody, CEO, Mercor, Fortune, January 2026

> "the way people work is changing as we move toward a more fractional, gig-like work model"

## Salesforce (Evolution)

### Raw Observations
- EVOLUTION: Added "Chief AI and Transformation Officer" role (Eric Hysen) in Aug 2025
- Hysen reports to President/Chief Legal Officer Sabastian Niles — scope is legal, government, compliance, public affairs, and "trusted agentics"
- Hysen's background: Former CAIO at DHS, former CIO at DHS, Google SWE/PM, Biden-Harris Transition tech strategy, Harvard CS
- Government-to-corporate CAIO pipeline: DHS CAIO → Salesforce Chief AI & Transformation Officer
- Role mandate: accelerate AI adoption, integrate AI across legal/compliance/government affairs
- This is in ADDITION to existing Salesforce AI leadership (Agentforce, engineering AI teams) — represents functional AI leadership for internal corporate affairs

### Evolution Flags
- EVOLUTION: Salesforce added functional CAIO (legal/corporate affairs) alongside existing product AI leadership — creating dual AI leadership structure: product AI teams (Agentforce) + internal AI transformation officer

### Open Questions
- How does Hysen's role interact with Salesforce's product AI teams?
- Is this a model for other companies — separate AI officers for internal transformation vs. product AI?

---

## Anthropic (Evolution)

### Raw Observations
- Jack Clark (co-founder) on Conversations with Tyler (March 2025): described office as "cheerful blankness" — brand oriented toward being "tasteful and thoughtful, and also not too flashy"
- Inherited former Slack HQ in San Francisco, hasn't fully redesigned — keeping costs modest
- Clark predicts "manager nerds" era: "being able to manage fleets of AI agents and orchestrate them is going to make people incredibly powerful"
- Observes startups operating with "very small numbers of employees relative to what they used to have because they have lots of coding agents working for them"
- On AI monitoring: Anthropic grapples with how much to monitor AI chains of thought — monitoring might create anti-goal where system produces safe-looking reasoning that breaks how it thinks
- Cultural values embedded in AI: AI systems embed values of creators, creating "soft power" effects comparable to Hollywood — structural implication for how AI labs organize around values/culture
- Concern about protected jobs without meaning creating "angst and nihilism"
- Human supervision appears permanent: "people will preferentially select the media which is fronted by other people"

### Quotes
> "being able to manage fleets of AI agents and orchestrate them is going to make people incredibly powerful"
> — Jack Clark, Co-founder, Anthropic, Conversations with Tyler, May 2025

> [On Anthropic's office:] "cheerful blankness... oriented around trying to be tasteful and thoughtful, and also not too flashy"
> — Jack Clark, Co-founder, Anthropic, Conversations with Tyler, May 2025

### Open Questions
- How has Anthropic's internal structure evolved since Clark's interview (March 2025 → now)?
- How do the "manager nerds" thesis and "soft power" framing connect to Anthropic's own organizational choices?

---

### Broader Patterns Emerging
1. **AI Restructuring Backlash Cycle**: Companies lay off for AI → regret (55%) → quietly rehire offshore/lower pay → equilibrium. Forrester + Deutsche Bank both warning of "AI redundancy washing"
2. **Dual AI Leadership**: Salesforce model of separate product AI teams + internal AI transformation officer may become template
3. **Platform Companies as AI Org Architects**: Atlassian (Teamwork Graph + Rovo agents) and Mercor (AI-matched gig workforce) are building the infrastructure that reshapes OTHER companies' org structures
4. **Entry-Level Elimination Paradox**: Companies cutting entry-level roles while Gen Z has highest AI quotient — creating structural talent pipeline problems
5. **Industrial AI Restructuring Wave**: Dow joins Amazon, Coca-Cola in using AI as driver for traditional industry restructuring — "radical simplification" framing
