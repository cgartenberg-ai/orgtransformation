## Meta (EVOLUTION — 5th Major AI Restructuring)

### Raw Observations
- Meta completed its 5th major AI restructuring: all AI teams consolidated under **Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL)**, led by new CAIO Alexandr Wang
- **Alexandr Wang** (founder of Scale AI, age 28) hired as Meta's first-ever Chief AI Officer in June 2025 as part of a **$14.3B deal** for 49% stake in Scale AI
- MSL split into **4 units**: TBD Lab (frontier models, led by ChatGPT co-creator Shengjia Zhao), FAIR (research → feeds TBD), Products & Applied Research (led by Nat Friedman, former GitHub CEO), MSL Infra (led by Aparna Ramani)
- Wang's October 2025 internal memo described restructuring as "disruptive" — aimed at eliminating bureaucracy in Meta's AI org
- **600 positions cut** from MSL in October 2025, but TBD Lab hires protected
- Zuckerberg personally leading recruitment: meeting candidates at Lake Tahoe and Palo Alto homes, offering 7-9 figure compensation packages
- 8 researchers poached from OpenAI, DeepMind, and Anthropic
- **Yann LeCun departed** November 2025 after 12 years — tension with Wang over reporting lines. LeCun: "You certainly don't tell a researcher like me what to do"
- LeCun admitted Llama 4 benchmarks were "fudged a little bit" — different models used for different benchmarks
- Zuckerberg statement: "2026 will be when AI starts to dramatically change the way that we work"
- Meta Reality Labs cut 1,500 in January 2026

> "You don't tell a researcher what to do. You certainly don't tell a researcher like me what to do."
> — Yann LeCun, former Chief AI Scientist, Meta, [The Decoder](https://the-decoder.com/you-certainly-dont-tell-a-researcher-like-me-what-to-do-says-lecun-as-he-exits-meta-for-his-own-startup/), November 2025

### Evolution Flags
- EVOLUTION: Separate FAIR + GenAI Product teams → Unified MSL with 4 specialized units under single CAIO (Alexandr Wang) as of October 2025
- EVOLUTION: LeCun as Chief AI Scientist → LeCun departure, Wang assumes AI leadership as of November 2025
- Source: https://www.axios.com/2025/10/22/meta-superintelligence-tbd-ai-reorg

### Open Questions
- How does TBD Lab's frontier model work relate to FAIR's research mission? Is FAIR now subordinate?
- What happened to the previous AI leadership layer (Ahmad Al-Dahle, who ran GenAI)?
- How does Nat Friedman's Products & Applied Research unit interact with existing product teams (Instagram, WhatsApp)?
- Is the 4-unit structure stable or will further consolidation follow?

## AMI Labs (NEW)

### Raw Observations
- **Advanced Machine Intelligence Labs** — founded by Yann LeCun after departing Meta, January 2026
- Pursuing **world models** (V-JEPA architecture): AI that understands physics, maintains persistent memory, plans complex actions — explicit rejection of LLM approach
- CEO is Alex LeBrun; LeCun is Executive Chair ("too disorganized for this, and also too old" for day-to-day)
- Fundraising: **€500M raise at ~€3B valuation** — one of largest pre-launch AI raises ever
- Headquarters in Paris (planned early 2026)
- Partnership with Meta continues despite departure — non-compete apparently not enforced
- Partnership with Nabla (healthcare) for "first access" to world model tech — targeting FDA-certifiable agentic AI
- "Baby" versions expected within 1 year; full-scale systems in a few years
- This is a **pure exploration** venture: no product, no revenue, pre-paradigm research on a fundamentally different approach to AI

## Anthropic (EVOLUTION — IPO Preparation)

### Raw Observations
- Anthropic has hired **Wilson Sonsini** (firm that navigated Alphabet and LinkedIn IPOs) for 2026 IPO preparation
- Operating as **Public Benefit Corporation** with unique governance: **Long-Term Benefit Trust (LTBT)** holds special Class T shares with escalating board-election rights
- LTBT will eventually elect a majority of directors — giving independent safety/technical experts oversight
- No dual-class founder structure — unusual for tech companies
- Valuation reportedly **$350B** after $10B January funding round
- Revenue trajectory: **$1B early 2025 → $9B ARR by December 2025** → projections up to $26B for 2026

### Evolution Flags
- EVOLUTION: Private AI lab with safety focus → IPO-bound Public Benefit Corporation with LTBT governance and $350B valuation as of early 2026
- This is a fundamental structural transition: from research lab to public company, with novel governance designed to maintain mission alignment through the transition

### Open Questions
- Will the LTBT governance actually constrain commercial pressure, or will it be diluted pre-IPO?
- How does Anthropic's org structure compare to OpenAI's restructuring (profit cap removal, for-profit conversion)?
- What does Anthropic's internal org look like? Leadership team, team structure, research vs. product division?
- How does the $50B data center requirement change org structure? (Infrastructure becomes dominant cost center)

## Broader Trends

### 1. The Great AI Lab Spin-Out Wave
AMI Labs (LeCun from Meta) follows a pattern: SSI (Sutskever from OpenAI), Safe Superintelligence. Senior AI researchers are leaving major companies to start pure-exploration ventures. The talent-to-startup pipeline is now a structural feature of the AI lab ecosystem, not an anomaly.

### 2. Meta's AI Org as Case Study in Serial Restructuring
5 major AI restructurings in ~2 years. The pattern: each restructuring consolidates more aggressively, elevates younger/more aggressive leadership, and sheds the previous generation of AI leadership. The LeCun-Wang tension is a microcosm of the explore-execute tension: LeCun represents open-ended research; Wang represents product-oriented scaling.

### 3. AI IPO Race as Governance Experiment
Anthropic's LTBT vs. OpenAI's profit-cap removal represent two fundamentally different answers to the same question: how do you structure a frontier AI company for public markets? This is an organizational design problem, not just a financial one.

### 4. CoE Model Scaling to 100K+ Workforce
Infosys arming 100K engineers with AI coding tools via a formal CoE is a qualitatively different scale than the typical 50-person CoE. This is the services industry's answer to AI adoption — transform the entire workforce simultaneously rather than creating a separate exploration unit.

### 5. AI-Washing Intensifies as Credibility Problem
Pinterest is the most explicit case yet of tying workforce cuts to AI pivot, but analysts are increasingly skeptical. The gap between "AI as reason for restructuring" and "AI as actual driver of productivity gains" is widening. This is becoming a governance and investor relations problem, not just a narrative one.

## Notes for Next Session
- **Deep-scan backlog**: Lex Fridman #490 (State of AI 2026) — 4+ hour episode, low org-structural density but may have macro signals worth mining
- **Acquired Ballmer ep**: Low priority for org structure but revisit if HBR case study (Feb 3) reveals anything about Microsoft AI org
- **Dwarkesh**: No new 2026 content yet. Check back in 1-2 weeks
- **Conversations with Tyler**: Need fresh check — stale since Dec 2025
- **Earnings calls**: Q4 2025 earnings season is active — Microsoft, Google, Meta, Amazon earnings should have AI restructuring language. High priority for next session
- **Invest Like the Best**: Gavin Baker ep still HIGH priority for deep-scan
- **Meta MSL**: This specimen needs a major update in curation — the 4-unit structure, Wang CAIO, LeCun departure are all new layers
- **Anthropic**: Need to find internal org structure details (team composition, research vs. product split) before IPO S-1 filing
- **The Decoder**: Already in source registry from prior session; confirmed as high-value for AI lab personnel moves and internal dynamics
