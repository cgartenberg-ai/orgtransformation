## Organizations Observed

### NVIDIA

#### Raw Observations
- Engineers at NVIDIA use AI coding assistants (Cursor) "pervasively" — indicates enterprise-wide contextual adoption of AI tools within the engineering org
- Jensen frames the value of AI through a "purpose vs. tasks" lens: the purpose of a software engineer is to solve problems, coding is just one task. This philosophy appears to drive how NVIDIA thinks about AI deployment internally — not replacing roles but redefining what roles do
- Jensen states productivity gains from AI should lead to exploring more ideas and growth, not headcount reduction: "The more productive we are, the more ideas we can explore, the more growth as a result"
- NVIDIA continues aggressive hiring despite AI productivity gains — consistent with the "AI expands scope" rather than "AI replaces workers" thesis
- Jensen mentions drug companies "moving their R and D from wet labs to supercomputers" but doesn't name specifics
- Three new infrastructure job categories emerging: chip manufacturing, supercomputer plants, AI factories — each needing distinct organizational expertise

#### Quotes
> "The purpose of a software engineer is to solve known problems and to find new problems to solve. Coding is one of the tasks."
> — Jensen Huang, CEO NVIDIA, No Priors (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4kSlkESoQ8GPU6meWACSlf), ~37:49, January 8, 2026

> "The more productive we are, the more ideas we can explore, the more growth as a result."
> — Jensen Huang, CEO NVIDIA, No Priors (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4kSlkESoQ8GPU6meWACSlf), ~04:12, January 8, 2026

> "Nothing would give me more joy than none of them are coding at all. They're just solving problems."
> — Jensen Huang, CEO NVIDIA, No Priors (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4kSlkESoQ8GPU6meWACSlf), ~37:49, January 8, 2026

#### Open Questions
- How is NVIDIA's internal AI research structured? Do they have separate exploration labs vs. product teams?
- What is NVIDIA's internal AI adoption rate beyond engineering (e.g., sales, operations, legal)?
- How does NVIDIA's organizational structure handle the tension between its GPU business (execution) and its AI research/software ambitions (exploration)?

## Notes for Next Session
- This episode was light on organizational structure specifics — Jensen focused on macro AI trends, not NVIDIA's internal org design
- NVIDIA specimen already exists but could use a new layer on the "purpose vs. tasks" framework and pervasive Cursor adoption
- Consider scanning the Harvey (Gabe Pereyra) episode from Dec 5 — legal AI company with 1000 customers may have interesting org structure details
- Consider scanning the ElevenLabs episode (Dec 11) for startup organizational patterns
