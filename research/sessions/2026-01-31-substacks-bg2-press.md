## Organizations Observed

## Meta

### Raw Observations
- EVOLUTION: Meta reorganized AI division from previous structure → **Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL)** with 4 units: (1) TBD Lab (LLMs including Llama), (2) FAIR (long-term research), (3) Products & Applied Research, (4) MSL Infra
- Alexandr Wang (28, founder/former CEO of Scale AI) appointed **Chief AI Officer** and head of MSL. Meta acquired 49% stake in Scale AI for $14.3 billion partly to secure Wang's leadership
- Nat Friedman (former GitHub CEO) leads Products & Applied Research unit
- In October 2025, Meta cut ~600 positions from MSL (out of several thousand), affecting FAIR, product AI, and infra units — but **sparing** the TBD Lab unit. Wang memo: "By reducing the size of our team, fewer conversations will be required to make a decision"
- Yann LeCun (12 years at Meta, built FAIR) departed January 2026 to launch AMI Labs. Trigger: Zuckerberg pivoted away from long-term foundational research toward rapid product development under Wang. LeCun: "You don't tell a researcher what to do. You certainly don't tell a researcher like me what to do"
- Aggressive talent poaching: 11 new AI researchers from DeepMind (Jack Rae, Pei Sun), OpenAI (Jiahui Yu, Shengjia Zhao), and Anthropic (Joel Pobar). Zuckerberg personally recruiting at his homes, compensation packages "seven to nine figures"
- New model roadmap: **Mango** (image/video generation) and **Avocado** (text LLM, coding/reasoning) for H1 2026 — described as "first flagship models following the major AI reorganization"
- Internal tensions: lavish packages for recruits unsettled veteran staff; multiple reshuffles in rapid succession damaging morale
- Stratechery covered Meta Compute (Jan 14, 2026): Zuckerberg's bet that "winning in AI means winning with infrastructure" — also means retreating from Reality Labs

### Quotes
> "You don't tell a researcher what to do. You certainly don't tell a researcher like me what to do."
> — Yann LeCun, former Chief AI Scientist at Meta, [The Decoder](https://the-decoder.com/you-certainly-dont-tell-a-researcher-like-me-what-to-do-says-lecun-as-he-exits-meta-for-his-own-startup/), ~Jan 2026

> "By reducing the size of our team, fewer conversations will be required to make a decision, and each person will be more load-bearing and have more scope and impact."
> — Alexandr Wang, Head of Meta Superintelligence Labs, internal memo via [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/10/22/meta-superintelligence-tbd-ai-reorg), October 2025

### Evolution Flags
- EVOLUTION: Previous dual-track structure (GenAI team under Chris Cox + FAIR under LeCun) → Consolidated Meta Superintelligence Labs under Alexandr Wang (4 units), as of ~Oct 2025
- EVOLUTION: FAIR protected research lab → FAIR now one of four units under commercial-product leadership, triggering chief scientist departure
- EVOLUTION: Reality Labs investment → retreating from Reality Labs to fund AI infrastructure ("Meta Compute"), as of Jan 2026

### Open Questions
- How does FAIR operate within MSL? Does it retain research autonomy or is it now directed by product needs?
- What happened to Chris Cox's role in the AI structure?
- How has the 600-person layoff affected specific research programs?

### Raw Observations
- Founded by **Yann LeCun** (Turing Award winner, 65, Meta's Chief AI Scientist for 12 years) after departing Meta in January 2026
- LeCun is **Executive Chair** (not CEO): "I'm too disorganized for this, and also too old"
- CEO is **Alex LeBrun** (operational leader)
- Focus: "**world models**" — AI systems that understand physics, maintain persistent memory, plan complex actions (vs. LLM next-token prediction)
- Technology based on **V-JEPA** architecture (created at Meta), trains on video/spatial data
- Fundraising: seeking **€500M at €3-3.5 billion valuation** — one of AI's largest pre-launch raises
- HQ in **Paris**
- Meta will not invest in AMI Labs, but plans to forge a **partnership**
- Timeline: "baby" versions within a year, full-scale systems a few years after

## Thematic Observations (Not Org-Specific)

### From Substacks

**Stratechery (Ben Thompson)**:
- "AI Integration and Modularization" framework: Amazon treats AI value chain as modular/commodity; Google is "the Apple of AI" (integrated approach)
- "What a company makes — and how it makes it — is indelibly tied up into how the company is structured" (Stratechery Concepts page)
- Jan 2026 focus on infrastructure competition and power generation challenges

**One Useful Thing (Ethan Mollick)**:
- "Reshaping the Tree" (Nov 2023): Drew parallel to Daniel McCallum's railroad reorganization 150 years ago — same challenge of rebuilding an org around fundamental shift in work
- Over 50% of AI users at work doing so **without approval**; 64% passed off AI work as own
- "The Present Future" (Nov 2024): "We do not need super-powerful AIs for the transformation of work — we already have more capabilities in today's GPT-4 class systems than we have fully absorbed"
- Jan 7, 2026 post ("Claude Code and What Comes Next"): AI agent autonomously built and deployed a working website in 1hr 14min — illustrative of shifting org capabilities

### From Press (Broader Trends)
- **CAIO role explosion**: 40%+ of Fortune 500 expected to have CAIO in 2026 (from 11% → 26% → 40%+)
- **AI-driven workforce restructuring** at scale: Salesforce (4,000 support cuts), Klarna (40% workforce reduction), Accenture (11,000 layoffs), HP (major restructuring)
- Fortune: "The AI layoff wave is just beginning — and it's by design"
- SHRM: "The winners of 2026 will not be those who flatten fastest, but those who align technology with talent, evidence, and judgment"
- 37% of US company leaders believe AI will take over roles by late 2026 (Resume.org survey of 1,000 leaders)
- i4cp: "2026 will be the year that large companies stop treating AI merely as a productivity tool and start wielding it as a strategic lever for workforce restructuring"
- CEOs surveyed by Salesforce: 80% expect blended human-AI workforces; 72% believe most employees will have an AI agent reporting to them within 5 years

## Notes for Next Session

### Follow-ups Needed
- **Deep-scan BG2 Pod**: Satya Nadella + Sam Altman Halloween episode (OpenAI/Microsoft partnership details, revenue sharing, AGI milestones)
- **Deep-scan BG2 Pod**: OpenAI CPO Kevin Weil episode (product strategy)
- **Deep-scan Cheeky Pint**: Greg Brockman, Des Traynor, Kyle Vogt episodes (carryover from prior session)
- **Stratechery**: "AI and the Human Condition" (Jan 5) and "AI Power, Now and In 100 Years" (Feb 2026) — need deep read
- **Not Boring**: No 2026 AI org articles found — may need to search Packy McCormick on X/LinkedIn for recent takes
- **The Generalist + Import AI**: Not scanned this session — remain Tier 1 gaps
- **Tesla "Operation Maestro"**: Need more structural detail on what this reorganization actually entails
- **Google Project EAT**: Need follow-up as more details emerge from the leaked memo
