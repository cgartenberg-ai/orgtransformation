## Broader Trends (Macro — not org-specific but structurally relevant)

### "AI Potential vs. AI Performance" Layoff Paradox
- HBR article (Jan 29, 2026) by Davenport & Srinivasan: companies are laying off workers based on AI's *potential*, not its demonstrated performance
- BCG survey: 60% of 1,250 firms saw "minimal revenue and cost gains despite substantial investment" in AI
- Oxford Economics: employment disruption isn't from AI replacing workers — it's from budget reallocation TO AI experiments, cutting other wages
- Deutsche Bank: "AI redundancy washing will be a significant feature of 2026"
- **Structural implication**: Organizations are restructuring around anticipated AI capabilities, not proven ones — creating a gap between org design and actual AI deployment

### Mercer Global Talent Trends 2026
- Employee AI job loss concern: 28% (2024) → 40% (2026)
- 62% of employees feel leaders underestimate AI's emotional/psychological impact; only 19% of HR leaders address it in digital strategy
- 63% of C-suite believe redesigning work for AI yields highest ROI in 2026
- Only ~33% feel workforce is equipped for human-AI collaboration
- 72% of investors favor companies integrating human + AI capabilities
- 97% of investors say funding negatively impacted by firms failing to upskill workers on AI
- **Structural implication**: Investor pressure is now actively shaping AI org design — firms that don't restructure for human-AI collaboration face capital access penalties

### CAIO Role Acceleration (continued)
- 48% of FTSE 100 now have CAIOs; 42% of appointments since Jan 2024
- PwC 2026 framework: CAIO evolving from single role to "portfolio of accountable owners" across value creation, governance, and production
- New pipeline confirmed: CTO→CAIO (IndoStar), consumer tech→CAIO (Invent/Zimmerman)
- i4cp: 2026 will be the year large companies stop treating AI as productivity tool and start using it as "strategic lever for workforce restructuring"
