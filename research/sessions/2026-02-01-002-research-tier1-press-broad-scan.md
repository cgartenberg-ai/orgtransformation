## Broader Trends

### 1. CAIO Role Approaching Ubiquity
- Estimated 40%+ of Fortune 500 will have a CAIO by end of 2026 (up from ~10% in 2024)
- Federal mandate: all US Executive departments required to appoint CAIO since April 2024
- Role spreading beyond tech/finance into advertising (Stagwell, Monks, IPG), government (NASA transition, US Cyber Command), and logistics

### 2. The 93/7 Problem (Deloitte CTO Bill Briggs)
Companies spending 93% of AI budget on technology and only 7% on people. This is the organizational structure failure that the field guide documents — structural investment without corresponding human/cultural investment.

### 3. "Broad Experimentation → Targeted Scaling" (EY CEO Outlook)
Shift from universal deployment to identifying specific business units where AI delivers differentiated value. This maps to our Tension #2 (Speed of Deployment vs. Depth of Learning) — movement from the wide-deployment phase toward depth.

### 4. 245,000 Tech Jobs Lost (Q4 2025 - Jan 2026)
Massive layoff wave across tech, with AI cited as driver. Reinforces candidate mechanism "AI-Driven Workforce Restructuring as Structural Lever." Many companies are restructuring based on "fewer management tiers" — convergent with UPS/Microsoft management delayering pattern.
