- Total "ripple effect" could reach 30,000 roles by May 2026
- Layoffs target middle management and corporate overhead; affected roles include Prime Video, AWS, HR, software engineers, and product teams
- Framed as removing "layers of bureaucracy" and "increasing ownership" — explicitly cultural, not financial
- $125B capital expenditure forecast for 2026 (highest among megacap companies), heavily weighted toward AI infrastructure
- $100B AI investment explicitly linked to the layoff decisions
- 2,400 jobs cut in Washington state alone, tied to 10-year AI commitment
- CEO Andy Jassy: efficiency gains from AI would "likely cause Amazon's corporate head count to fall in coming years"
- Beth Galetti (SVP People Experience): didn't rule out more cuts but said not trying to create "a new rhythm" of broad layoffs
- Company is financially strong: Q4 profits up ~40% to ~$21B, revenue >$180B
- Affected employees get 90 days to find internal roles + severance

## Substack Triage: The Generalist

No directly relevant articles found for AI organizational structure. The Generalist focuses on company profiles and VC analysis. Key articles scanned:
- "Future 50" (Aug 2025) — AI startup database, not org structure focused
- "What to Watch in 2025" (Jan 2025) — AI trends, not structural
- "Founders Guide to Leveraging AI" (Mar 2024) — tactical, not organizational

**Assessment**: Low relevance for core research question. Continue to monitor but deprioritize.

---

## Substack Triage: Import AI

Jack Clark's Import AI covers AI research and policy. Recent content (late 2025-early 2026) focuses on:
- PostTrainBench: measuring AI researcher task automation (predicts human baseline beaten by Sep 2026)
- "AI Economy" divergence: people working with frontier AI feel like they live in a parallel world
- ChipMind: data structuring for chip specs to enable LLM use
- Science fiction elements exploring agent autonomy

**Assessment**: Macro AI trends and policy rather than organizational structure. No specific org specimens. Continue to monitor for policy changes that affect org structures (e.g., EU AI Act compliance requiring new governance roles).

---

## Broader Trends Observed

### 1. AI-Driven Workforce Restructuring at Industrial Scale
- **Amazon**: 16,000 cuts (potentially 30,000 by May) + $125B CapEx in AI
- **Coca-Cola**: Phased restructuring + new CDO role + $1.1B Microsoft AI partnership
- **Broader**: ~245,000 tech jobs lost between Q4 2025 and Jan 2026
- **Key stat**: Nearly 37% of companies expect to have replaced jobs with AI by end of 2026
- **Nuance**: Financially strong companies making cuts (Amazon Q4 profits up 40%); this is strategic rebalancing, not distress

### 2. AI Center of Excellence as Dominant Enterprise Structure
- **Infosys**: 100,000-engineer CoE with Cursor (largest announced to date)
- **Deloitte, IBM, Oracle, NVIDIA, Microsoft**: All publishing CoE frameworks
- Federated model emerging (divisional CoEs within centralized governance)
- CoE as both "hub and coach" — providing reference architectures while enabling teams

### 3. AI Venture Studio Model Maturing
- **LG/NovaWave WaveX**: Corporate innovation center → external AI venture studio with public-private funding
- Geographical diversification: Silicon Valley + West Virginia + Arizona + international
- Model: corporate LP provides strategic collaboration; venture studio provides incubation

### 4. CAIO Role Expansion Into New Sectors
- **UK Government**: First national CAIO (Kalbir Sohi) — consumer tech + public sector background
- **CI MED**: First CAIO at an engineering-focused medical school
- **Pipeline diversification**: Spotify/Facebook → Government CAIO is a new career path type
- Joins existing CAIO trend: UBS, CBA, NASA, US Cyber Command, FDA, state governments

### 5. Acquired Podcast as AI Org Structure Archive
- "Google: The AI Company" episode provides deepest public narrative of Google's AI innovator's dilemma
- The podcast's company history format is uniquely suited to documenting explore/execute tension over time
- Bret Taylor + Clay Bavor episode directly addresses AI organizational strategy
