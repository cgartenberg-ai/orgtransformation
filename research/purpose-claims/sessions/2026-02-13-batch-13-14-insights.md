## I. Evidence Updates to Existing Insights

### rhetorical-division-mirrors-structure — 5 new specimens

| Specimen | Pattern | Register Split |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| Visa | Two-voice (CEO + Tech President) | McInerney = military/defensive ("arms race"), Taneja = developmental/craft ("toddler," "science and art"). New register pair: defensive/developmental. |
| Honda | CEO-dominant with translator | Mibe = visionary/identity/survival, Brizendine = commercial-success/operational. "Augment" bridges both tiers. |
| Lowe's | **First four-way division** | Ellison (CEO) = workforce/social, Nair (SVP Data/AI) = technical, Godbole (CIO) = customer experience, McFarland (EVP Stores) = adoption metrics. Maps to operational hierarchy, not hub-spoke. |
| Lionsgate | Audience-dependent division | Feltheimer = creative-first for talent, Burns = "candid channel" revealing commercial logic for investors. Division by audience, not structural role. |
| CVS Health | Tech leader as narrator | Mandadi (CXO) carries 9/14 claims. In M6a (no hub), the embedder IS the narrator. |

### ceo-silence-spectrum — 3 new data points

| Specimen | Pattern | Detail |
|----------|---------|--------|
| HP Inc | **Departed narrator** (NEW category) | Lores made 12/14 claims, then left for PayPal. Interim Broussard has 0 claims. Purpose narrative orphaned. First natural experiment in narrator departure. |
| CVS Health | Emerging from silence | New CEO Joyner has 2 tentative claims vs predecessor Lynch's stronger vision. Mandadi fills vacuum. |
| Honda | CEO-dominant with translator | 12/14 claims from Mibe, but Brizendine provides operationalizing voice. |

### sector-rhetorical-signatures — 3 new sectors

| Sector | Key Pattern |
|--------|------------|
| Japanese conglomerates (Honda, Panasonic) | Heritage-as-authorization via founder mythology. Zero utopian (Panasonic), bounded utopian (Honda). Dramatically longer time horizons (2035, 10-20yr). Internally-directed survival ("30 years of no growth"). Culturally specific — no Western parallel. |
| Entertainment (Lionsgate) | Confirms "serve creativity" convergence. Adds audience-dependent ordering: creativity-first for talent, efficiency-first for investors. Context-switched register. |
| Retail (Lowe's) | Zero utopian, zero higher-calling. Metric-dense (50% workload reduction, 2x conversion, 200 bps CSAT, 100B tokens). Highest metric density in retail. Confirms retail-practical pattern from Kroger. |

### anti-caio-thesis — CVS Health strongest case yet

Mandadi: "worst thing companies can do is create a CAIO." Paradox: rejecting concentrated AI leadership paradoxically *concentrates AI rhetoric* in one person (9/14 claims). Anti-CAIO thesis's strongest evidence is also its greatest complication.

### survival-rhetoric-signals-structural-absence — 2 new data points

| Specimen | Pattern |
|----------|---------|
| Panasonic | 5/10 survival — highest proportion in collection. "30 years of no growth" is most candid failure admission. Crucially *inward-directed* (organizational complacency, not competitor threat). New variant: survival rhetoric as organizational therapy. |
| Honda | Survival claims concentrated at inauguration (2021), then retired as identity/utopian take over. **Clearest evidence for survival rhetoric lifecycle** — survival deployed at inflection points, retired as structural solutions build. Directly confirms testable implication. |

## II. Three New Insights

### NEW: heritage-as-authorization
Honda invokes Soichiro Honda's "Power of Dreams"; Panasonic invokes Matsushita's founding vision. Both convert AI transformation from survival ("we must change") into identity ("we have always been this way"). Economically rational: reduces organizational resistance by framing discontinuity as continuity. Culturally specific to Japanese corporate culture — no Western parallel (closest: Disney/Walt, but Japanese founder-reverence runs deeper). Mechanism: heritage reduces the political cost of authorization.

### NEW: audience-dependent-claim-ordering
Lionsgate and Cognizant systematically invert purpose claim priorities by audience. Lionsgate: creativity-first for talent, efficiency-first for investors. Cognizant: "amplifier" for public, "digital labor" for investors. Not hypocrisy — rational communication design. Different audiences have different loss functions (talent fears displacement, investors fear insufficient returns). Leaders optimize framing to minimize salient risk per audience. This is a new mechanism for rhetorical division — not by structural role, but by stakeholder.

### NEW: ceo-departure-natural-experiment
HP Inc's Lores built entire AI narrative (12/14 claims, "identity-shedding" from PC vendor), then departed for PayPal before execution. Interim CEO Broussard has zero public AI claims. Natural experiment: can purpose claims survive the departure of the leader who made them? Complementarity theory predicts: if rhetoric was paired with structural commitments (Humane acquisition, HP IQ, $1B savings), structural momentum sustains transformation; if rhetoric was substituting for structure, transformation stalls. HP Inc is now the most important longitudinal case for testing whether purpose claims are load-bearing or decorative.

## III. Signals Not Yet Formalized

- **Physical-world delimitation** (Lowe's: "AI can't fix your roof"): anti-displacement strategy anchored to physical product nature. Similar to Kroger's berry-freshness domain specificity. Only 2 cases — watch for more retail/physical-goods specimens.
- **Visa's absence of workforce claims**: Visa has zero workforce/reskilling language despite massive AI deployment. As infrastructure (network) rather than people-intensive (advisory), the "what about our people" question doesn't arise. Infrastructure firms may structurally lack the rhetorical need for workforce claims.
