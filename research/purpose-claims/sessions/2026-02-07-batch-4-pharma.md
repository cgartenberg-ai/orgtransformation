## Claims Found

### pfizer (10 claims)
1. **transformation-framing** — "What we are embarking on is nothing short of a scientific renaissance..." — Bourla, JPMorgan Healthcare
   - Rhetorically positions the most radical departure as a return to scientific identity
2. **identity** — "We've never been a tech company, but we've always been a science company..." — Bourla, Fortune
   - Establishes continuity: AI adoption as extending heritage, not breaking from it
3. **direction-under-uncertainty** — "I am confident that our accelerated evolution of our pipeline..." — Bourla, Earnings Call
   - Justifies R&D CapEx through patient-outcome framing
4. **transformation-framing** — "The way we do science is fundamentally changing..." — Bourla, Fortune
   - "Fundamentally" signals structural, not incremental, change
5. **employee-deal** — "Digital will become part of every job... expected to become literate in digital tools..." — Bracken, Press
   - Resets employment contract: AI literacy is mandatory
6. **identity** — "Every great science company has to be a great technology company..." — Bourla, Fortune
   - "Has to be" converts choice into necessity
7. **utopian** — "In fact, I don't think that we can any more call it digital transformation. It's a new way of doing business." — Bracken, Amazon
   - Declares the old framing inadequate; this is bigger than "transformation"
8. **direction-under-uncertainty** — "We're investing hundreds of millions of dollars in these areas..." — Bourla, Earnings Call
   - Concrete dollar commitment without specified ROI
9. **sacrifice-justification** — "We took some very bold and dramatic steps early... Now we are confident that the bold decisions..." — Bourla, Earnings Call
   - Retrospective sacrifice-justification: the pain was worth it
10. **teleological** — "Pfizer's purpose is about breakthroughs that change patients' lives..." — Bourla, Press
    - Anchors entire AI agenda in patient outcomes

### novo-nordisk (11 claims)
1. **teleological** — "...using data and AI to drive real change and improve the lives of patients around the world." — Zimmer (CAIO), Press
2. **identity** — "...built on more than a century of science and data-driven innovation..." — Zimmer (CAIO), Press

## Analytical Notes

### Key Findings from Batch 4

**1. Pharma purpose claims are patient-anchored universally.**
Every pharma specimen connects AI investment to patient outcomes. This is the teleological backbone: AI exists to serve patients. Even transformation-framing and direction-under-uncertainty claims circle back to patient benefit. This contrasts with tech companies where the teleological anchor is more diffuse (Meta: "new era for humanity"; Shopify: productivity).

**2. The CEO gap: purpose claims are distributed across AI/digital leaders.**
Novo Nordisk's CEO yielded ZERO AI-context purpose claims. Pfizer's claims are Bourla-dominated but only in formal settings. Roche-Genentech's 18 claims are overwhelmingly from Regev (EVP, not CEO). This is a structural finding: in pharma, AI purpose claims come from the AI/digital leadership layer, not the CEO. Tech companies are the opposite (Zuckerberg, Nadella, Lutke = CEO-centric claims).

**3. Regev is an outlier data point — possibly the richest single speaker in our collection.**
18 claims from one person across multiple sources and claim types. Compare: Zuckerberg 9, Amodei 14, Nadella ~8. Regev's rhetorical range is extraordinary — she makes utopian, sacrifice, employee-deal, identity, and direction-under-uncertainty claims, all with vivid metaphors ("accent," "no Plan B," "decorating"). She may be the single most purposeful AI transformation leader in our herbarium.

**4. Direction-under-uncertainty is overrepresented in pharma.**
Pharma specimens produce more direction-under-uncertainty claims proportionally than tech specimens. This is consistent with pharma's long time horizons and genuine uncertainty about AI's drug discovery impact. Leaders can say "we are still learning" because drug discovery inherently operates under deep uncertainty.

**5. Sacrifice-justification is pharma-specific.**
Roche-Genentech's claim 010 (designing molecules that fail as drugs but succeed as training data) is the most concrete sacrifice-justification in our collection. The sacrifice is named (molecule teams), the cost is acknowledged ("never going to be a drug"), and the purpose is provided ("good for all drugs"). This level of specificity doesn't appear in tech specimens.

**6. Identity-continuity as anxiety management.**
Both Novo Nordisk ("century of science and data-driven innovation") and Pfizer ("We've always been a science company") use identity claims to reframe AI as continuous with heritage. This reduces organizational anxiety by making AI feel like an extension of existing identity, not a disruption. Pattern #2 (two speakers, two registers) applies here too: the identity-continuity frame is the CAIO/CDIO's job, while the CEO does broader purpose framing.

## Infrastructure Update

**Agent speed optimization completed this session:**
- SKILL.md rewritten: 8 search queries → 5 consolidated queries
- Agents now use `model: "sonnet"` (5-10x faster than Opus for web scraping)
- Serial WebFetch only (prevents sibling-error cascades)
- One-retry-max discipline added
- Known-blocked domains documented (bloomberg.com, wsj.com, etc.)
- Sanofi re-run as first test of optimized pipeline

## Next Steps

1. Merge sanofi when agent completes
2. Begin Batch 5: high-priority unscanned specimens (nvidia, tesla, duolingo, intercom)
3. Test optimized pipeline throughput — expect 4 specimens in ~15-20 minutes vs. 50+ minutes
4. Update claim type distribution table with Batch 3+4 numbers (now 152 claims across 17 specimens)
