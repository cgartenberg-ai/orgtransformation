## Analytical Notes

### Pattern 1: Purpose Claims Escalate With Structural Disruption
Meta's purpose claims intensify at moments of structural change: the MSL founding (utopian), the 600-person layoff (transformation + sacrifice), and the Q4 earnings (employee-deal + CapEx authorization). This is consistent with the hypothesis that purpose claims do organizational work — they're not decoration, they're authorization mechanisms.

### Pattern 2: Two Speakers, Two Registers
Zuckerberg speaks in utopian and identity registers: "new era for humanity," "talent-dense," "personal superintelligence for everyone." Wang speaks in transformation and sacrifice registers: "fewer conversations," "disruptive but necessary." The division of rhetorical labor is clean — founder handles vision, CAIO handles operational justification.

### Pattern 3: "Talent-Dense" as Recurring Identity Frame
"Talent-dense" appears in at least 3 separate Zuckerberg statements across 7 months (Threads post, MSL founding context, Q4 earnings). It's not a one-off — it's become Meta's core organizational identity claim for MSL. This is analytically important: it means the organizational identity is defined by who's in the room, not what they produce.

### Pattern 4: CapEx Authorization via Purpose
$115-135B CapEx has no standard NPV justification. Zuckerberg's authorization mechanism is purpose: "beginning of a new era," "personal superintelligence for everyone," "we have the resources." The financial case ("profitable over some period") is deliberately vague. This is the clearest case in our sample of purpose substituting for profit signals at massive scale.

### Pattern 5: Competitive Positioning via Purpose
Meta.com/superintelligence explicitly contrasts Meta's "personal empowerment" vision with unnamed competitors who "believe superintelligence should be directed centrally towards automating all valuable work." Purpose claims are doing market differentiation work — defining what Meta is by defining what it's not.

## Next Steps
1. **Scan Microsoft** — Nadella is the canonical "identity" purpose claim speaker (growth mindset + "empower every person"). Direct comparison with Zuckerberg.
2. **Scan Amazon** — Jassy's "it's culture" statement and the 30K layoff framing are likely employee-deal + sacrifice-justification.
3. **Scan Shopify** — Lutke's "prove AI can't do it" memo is the purest employee-deal claim.
4. **Scan Eli Lilly** — 18-year time horizons as direction-under-uncertainty.
5. **Scan ServiceNow** — McDermott's "obliterate 20th century org charts" is peak utopian.
