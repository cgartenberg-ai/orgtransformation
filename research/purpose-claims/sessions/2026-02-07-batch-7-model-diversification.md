## Analytical Notes

### New Patterns

- **#26**: Non-tech enterprise CEOs (McMillon, Bancel) use strikingly different purpose framing than tech CEOs — anchored in people, not technology. "People-led, tech-powered" vs. "compound AI systems."
- **#27**: Moderna represents the most aggressive enterprise-wide AI adoption rhetoric in the collection — 100% of knowledge workers on ChatGPT daily, AI training required for all, 2000+ GPTs. This is the M6a ideal type.
- **#28**: Ghodsi's purpose rhetoric is unusually candid about uncertainty — "never meet your heroes," "95% of AI projects fail," LLM commoditization. This is direction-under-uncertainty as HONEST SKEPTICISM rather than confident vision.
- **#29**: Deloitte's thin self-referential claims confirm Pattern #21 (professional services firms talk about clients, not themselves). The 5 claims we found are notable for being rare exceptions.
- **#30**: Walmart's McMillon is the most balanced purpose carrier in the collection — nearly equal representation across all 7 claim types. Suggests a retail CEO communicating to ALL stakeholders simultaneously.

### Hypothesis Updates

- **H5 confirmed**: Walmart's McMillon anchors transformation in people/jobs ("every job will change") and opportunity, not in technology vision. Operations-heavy firms do use efficiency/survival framing.
- **H8 (new)**: Enterprise-wide adoption models (M6a) generate disproportionately heavy transformation-framing claims — the leader must constantly narrate the ongoing change because the "lab" is the entire org.

### Industry Distribution After Batch 7

Now have claims from: Technology (12), Pharmaceuticals (5), Financial Services (5), Retail (1), Logistics (1), Consumer Goods (1), Professional Services (2), Telecommunications (1), E-commerce (1)

## Next Steps

- Merge complete. 294 claims across 29 specimens.
- 64 specimens remain unscanned (1 excluded).
- Priority for Batch 8: Consider Nvidia (M4, guaranteed rich), Tesla/Duolingo (M3 gap), JPMorgan (financial services + M4 diversity).
