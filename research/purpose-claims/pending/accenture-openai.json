      "rhetoricalFunction": "Resets the implicit employment contract at Accenture. Reskillability is now a condition of continued employment. This is the clearest CEO articulation in our collection of the 'exit the non-reskillable' pattern — it explicitly names the boundary between who stays and who goes, and frames the decision as evidence-based ('based on our experience') rather than arbitrary. It converts what could be seen as mass layoffs into a purposeful workforce recomposition.",

The phrase 'compressed timeline' signals urgency — this is not gradual attrition but deliberate acceleration. The 'based on our experience' qualifier frames the decision as empirically grounded, not ideological. Confirmed verbatim across Fortune and CNBC coverage."

Sweet is the CEO of the world's largest consulting firm admitting that AI returns are underwhelming — yet she is simultaneously announcing the largest AI workforce restructuring in consulting history.

'Five decades' places the current AI moment as the most significant shift in work since the 1970s (rise of knowledge work, offshoring, early computing).

Sweet is doing two things: (1) validating the pain felt by employees and clients, and (2) recasting the decision-maker as someone who bears the emotional burden of hard choices. The word 'courage' converts a cost-cutting exercise into a moral act. 'Humility' suggests the decision was made with awareness of its limits, not hubris.
