    "keyFindings": [
      "Mayo Clinic's purpose rhetoric operates on three distinct registers across its multi-hub leadership: Farrugia (CEO) speaks in architectural teleology and institutional vision; Halamka (Platform) speaks in pragmatic survival and demystification; Tripathi (CAIO) speaks in service hierarchy and moral framing; Ross (former CIO) speaks in ambidextrous identity. Each leader's rhetoric maps cleanly onto their structural role.",
      "The survival claims at Mayo are distinctive because they derive from healthcare labor economics (workforce shortages, aging populations) rather than competitive threat. This grounds the 'adapt-or-die' framing in demographic fact rather than market anxiety—a pattern that may be unique to healthcare specimens.",
      "Ross's claim about 'two jobs' (world's best hospital + Silicon Valley speed) is among the most explicitly ambidextrous statements in the entire collection. Most specimens implicitly manage the exploration-execution tension; Ross names it outright and claims both mandates as equally legitimate.",
      "The augmentation-not-replacement claim appears from multiple speakers (Tripathi, Halamka), suggesting it is not individual conviction but organizational doctrine—a coordinated identity boundary that prevents clinical resistance to AI adoption.",
      "Halamka's 'math, not magic' and 'pharmaceutical' analogies systematically demystify AI, which serves a specific organizational function: if AI is mundane math requiring post-market surveillance, then clinicians can engage with it using their existing evidence-based frameworks rather than treating it as alien technology."
    ],
    "rhetoricalPatterns": [
      "Service hierarchy nesting: Technology serves clinicians who serve patients—a three-layer purpose chain that places AI at the bottom, making adoption an act of humility rather than disruption (Tripathi's signature framing).",
      "Survival-through-demography: Unlike tech-sector survival claims (competitors will eat you), Mayo's survival claims invoke structural workforce shortages, making AI adoption morally obligatory rather than competitively necessary.",
      "Bounded ambition: Multiple claims establish safety as the hard constraint and speed as the objective function ('as fast as we can, but no faster than is safe'; 'think big, start small, move fast'). This resolves the speed-vs-depth tension at the rhetorical level.",
      "Demystification as authorization: Halamka systematically reduces AI to familiar clinical categories (math, pharmaceuticals, standard of care) to make it legible to physician culture and remove both fear and hype."
    ],
    "comparativeNotes": "Mayo Clinic's purpose claims are notably richer and more diverse than other healthcare specimens. Compared to CVS Health and UnitedHealth Group, which tend toward commercial-success claims (efficiency, cost reduction), Mayo's claims cluster around higher-calling, identity, and teleological types—consistent with its nonprofit academic medical center positioning. The 'hero job' framing (Ross) and 'serve the people who serve others' (Tripathi) have no parallel in for-profit healthcare specimens. Mount Sinai and Sutter Health are closer comparisons as academic medical centers, but neither has produced claims with Mayo's structural self-awareness—Ross's explicit 'two jobs' framing is unique. The multi-speaker distribution (4 distinct leaders with different rhetorical registers) also distinguishes Mayo from specimens that rely on a single CEO voice. Farrugia is present but not dominant; the purpose rhetoric is genuinely distributed across the C-suite.",
    "notableAbsences": "Sanjay Sehgal (CDAO) is entirely absent from the public record—no interviews, no purpose claims, no keynotes found. This is notable given that Sehgal runs the 'AI Factory,' which is arguably Mayo's most structurally interesting capability. The absence of Sehgal's voice means we hear nothing from the operational enablement layer. Also absent: any commercial-success claims about revenue generation or cost savings from AI. Mayo's rhetoric is almost entirely mission-framed, with commercial outcomes treated as implicit rather than stated. No explicit claims about competitive threat from other health systems' AI efforts.",

  "scanNarrative": "The Mayo Clinic scan yielded a rich and structurally illuminating set of 18 purpose claims across four distinct leaders and multiple source types. Five web searches produced a strong set of candidate URLs spanning press coverage, long-form interviews, podcast references, and conference reports. Of six URLs fetched, five returned useful content (CXOTalk returned 403).\n\nThe most productive sources were the Insight Partners interview with Cris Ross (6 claims, including the explicitly ambidextrous 'two jobs' framing), the Chief Healthcare Executive interview with Halamka (4 claims including the headline survival claim 'We have to use AI'), and the HealthSystemCIO article with Halamka's 'overnight revolution, 50 years in the making.' The Eric Topol / Ground Truths interview with Halamka provided operational quotes but fewer purpose-level claims. The existing specimen already contained strong Farrugia and Tripathi quotes from the Microsoft podcast, GovTech, and OncoDaily sources.\n\nWhat makes Mayo distinctive in the collection is the distributed nature of its purpose rhetoric. Rather than a single CEO voice driving the narrative (as in Sanofi's Hudson or Roche's Regev), Mayo has four leaders each operating in a different rhetorical register that maps onto their structural role. Farrugia speaks as the institutional architect, Halamka as the pragmatic demystifier, Tripathi as the mission guardian, and Ross as the ambidexterity translator. This rhetorical division of labor mirrors the structural division of labor in Mayo's multi-hub M4 architecture.\n\nThe claim type distribution is heavily weighted toward identity (5) and teleological (5) claims, with a notable cluster of higher-calling claims (3) that reflect Mayo's nonprofit mission orientation. The near-absence of commercial-success claims (just 1, and that one borderline) is striking and distinguishes Mayo sharply from for-profit healthcare specimens. The survival claims derive from demographic workforce shortages rather than competitive threat, which is a healthcare-specific pattern worth tracking across the collection."
