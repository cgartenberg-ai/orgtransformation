      "The 'Hollywood model' — making AI capital permanent and humans variable — is a radical inversion of the labor arbitrage model that built Indian IT services. It openly acknowledges the end of the body-shop era.",
      "'Context engineering' as a named discipline is Kumar's answer to the commoditization threat: AI is only as good as your understanding of the organization it serves. This positions tacit client knowledge as an irreplaceable competitive moat.",

      "Dual-register narration: 'digital labor' (investor) vs. 'amplifier of human potential' (public). Kumar systematically adjusts his framing based on audience — more candid about replacement on earnings calls, more humanistic in press interviews.",

      "Hollywood model as structural blueprint: project-based assembly with permanent AI infrastructure and variable human teams — a named organizational archetype for the AI era."
    ],
    "comparativeNotes": "Cognizant's rhetoric is substantially more candid than its IT services peers. Where Accenture (Julie Sweet) emphasizes reskilling obligations and presents a 'learn or leave' ultimatum, Kumar openly names 'digital labor' as a product category and describes humans as 'the variable component.' Infosys's 100K Cursor CoE is a tool-adoption story; Cognizant's Hollywood model is a structural-transformation story. Genpact focuses on specific process automation; Kumar operates at the level of industry architecture ('every industry is going to be a tech industry'). The most distinctive element is the 'broader pyramid' — while other IT services CEOs carefully avoid discussing workforce shape, Kumar directly addresses it, arguing AI makes the pyramid wider at the base rather than narrower. This may be partly tactical: Cognizant's fresher hiring numbers are a competitive advantage in India's labor market, and Kumar is signaling stability to a workforce anxious about AI displacement. But the Fortune interview reveals a genuine intellectual framework — if 'intelligence is not the asymmetry, applying intelligence is,' then the entire value proposition of IT services shifts from providing smart engineers to providing contextual judgment.",
    "notableAbsences": "No higher-calling or teleological claims found. Kumar's rhetoric is almost entirely commercial-success and identity-focused, with some survival and utopian elements. There is no moral duty framing ('we must do this for society'), no civilizational destiny claims beyond 'every industry becomes tech.' No other Cognizant executives besides Kumar appear in the claims — no CTO, no Chief AI Officer, no board members. This is a single-voice specimen.

  "scanNarrative": "The Cognizant scan produced a rich collection of 16 claims, almost exclusively from CEO Ravi Kumar S. Five web searches completed successfully with no failures, yielding strong coverage across earnings calls, long-form press profiles, analyst interviews, and a Fortune feature interview. Six URLs were fetched: Newsweek (two versions of a long-form profile), Fortune (the 'Hollywood model' interview, which proved the richest single source), Motley Fool (Q4 2025 earnings call transcript), Constellation Research (agentic AI analyst piece), and Yahoo Finance (video only, no usable transcript). The Newsweek pages returned truncated quotes on first fetch but the second version provided cleaner extraction.\n\nThe most analytically significant finding is Kumar's dual-register rhetoric. On the Q4 2025 earnings call, he speaks candidly about 'digital labor,' 'agentic capital,' and humans as 'the variable component' — language that openly names AI as labor replacement. In the Fortune interview, the same Kumar says 'AI is an amplifier of human potential. It's not a displacement strategy.' This is not contradiction but audience segmentation: investors get the replacement narrative (it's where the growth is), employees and the public get the amplification narrative (it's where the stability is).\n\nThe 'context engineering' concept is the most theoretically interesting claim for our project. Kumar argues that AI's probabilistic nature means it must 'bind to' organizational context — operating principles, tribal knowledge, cultural imperatives. This is essentially a transaction-cost argument: AI increases the returns to firm-specific knowledge, which means integrators who deeply understand client organizations become more valuable, not less. It's the inverse of the commoditization story most analysts tell about AI and IT services.\n\nThe claim type distribution skews heavily toward commercial-success (7 primary) and identity (5 primary), with zero higher-calling or teleological claims. This makes Cognizant rhetorically distinctive from pharma specimens (which lean teleological) and tech specimens (which lean utopian). Kumar is a pragmatist — his purpose claims are about what Cognizant will become and how it will make money, not about saving the world."
