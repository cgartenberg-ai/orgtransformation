    "keyFindings": [
      "PepsiCo's AI rhetoric is overwhelmingly operational and commercial — claims are grounded in physical value chain operations (farm to shelf, plants, warehouses, supply chain) rather than abstract civilizational transformation. This is distinctly CPG.",
      "The Laguarta/Kanioura partnership produces a complementary rhetorical division: Laguarta provides brief, high-level authorization claims (identity, light utopian) while Kanioura delivers detailed structural/teleological visions. This mirrors the CEO-CSTO reporting relationship.",
      "Kanioura's vocabulary is notably consistent across sources: 'future-fit company,' 'future-ready enterprise,' 'mission-based teams,' 'ecosystem of agents,' 'intelligent ecosystem.' She has built a coherent lexicon for PepsiCo's AI transformation narrative.",
      "The 330,000-employee training commitment creates a distinctive rhetorical constraint: purpose claims must work for warehouse workers and data scientists alike. This may explain the emphasis on human-AI collaboration framing ('don't just coexist, they collaborate') rather than replacement or augmentation language.",
      "WEF/Davos context elicits more utopian language from Laguarta ('transformative force,' 'once unimaginable') than corporate press releases, suggesting audience effects on purpose claim type."
    ],
    "rhetoricalPatterns": [
      "Physical-chain anchoring: AI purpose consistently tied to tangible operations (farm, shelf, plant, warehouse) rather than abstract knowledge work — 'farm to shelf' as signature phrase",
      "Journey framing: Transformation described as ongoing journey ('continued journey of becoming,' 'paving the way') rather than destination reached or crisis averted",
      "Ecosystem metaphor: Both leaders use biological/systems language ('ecosystem of agents,' 'intelligent ecosystem,' 'single intelligent ecosystem') to describe AI integration",
      "Self-reliance identity: Kanioura's 'responsible for its own fate' establishes technology independence as core organizational character — unusual for CPG"
    ],
    "comparativeNotes": "PepsiCo's AI rhetoric occupies a middle ground between pure operational efficiency (Kroger-style) and aspirational identity transformation (Nike-style). Where Nike positions AI as serving athletes and creative expression, and Kroger focuses on grocery supply chain optimization, PepsiCo combines operational grounding ('farm to shelf') with genuine identity aspiration ('becoming a future-fit company'). Laguarta is more rhetorically ambitious than typical CPG CEOs, willing to use epochal language at Davos ('transformative force driving smarter decisions'), but this is tempered by Kanioura's precision about concrete operational outcomes. The dual-voice structure (brief CEO authorization + detailed CSTO vision) is distinct from the single-CEO-dominated rhetoric seen in tech companies. Unlike Nike's consumer-facing purpose claims or Kroger's supply chain focus, PepsiCo frames AI purpose as organizational metamorphosis — changing what the company IS, not just what it does.",
    "notableAbsences": "No survival claims detected — PepsiCo never frames AI as existential threat or adapt-or-die imperative, despite operating in a highly competitive CPG market with private label pressure. No higher-calling claims — AI is never framed as moral duty or purpose transcending profit. The absence of survival rhetoric is notable given that Laguarta has spoken about competitive pressures elsewhere. The utopian claims that exist are mild/borderline — 'reimagines how supply chain is designed' and 'transformative force' are modest by tech CEO standards. No claims connect AI to pep+ sustainability goals, which is a surprising gap given that pep+ is PepsiCo's central strategic narrative.",
    "correctedLeaderInfo": "Athina Kanioura's title has been expanded: she is now 'CEO Latin America and Global Chief Strategy & Transformation Officer' as of December 2025 organizational changes, adding P&L responsibility to her transformation role.",

    }
  },
  "scanNarrative": "PepsiCo produces a rich and distinctive set of purpose claims that reveal how a consumer packaged goods giant frames AI transformation differently from technology companies. The scan yielded 12 qualifying claims across 4 successful URL fetches (from 6 attempts), drawing from CES 2026 press releases, the Salesforce Agentforce announcement, Consumer Goods Technology interviews, and existing specimen quotes.\n\nThe most striking finding is the rhetorical division of labor between CEO Ramon Laguarta and CSTO Athina Kanioura. Laguarta provides brief, high-altitude authorization — 'AI is reshaping our business in ways that were once unimaginable' and 'becoming a future-fit company.' Kanioura then fills in the structural and teleological details — 'building toward a world where every plant and warehouse operates as part of a single, intelligent ecosystem' and 'reimagining an enterprise where humans and intelligent agents don't just coexist, they collaborate.' This CEO/CSTO complementarity mirrors their organizational reporting relationship and produces a more complete purpose narrative than either voice alone.\n\nThe claim type distribution (4 identity, 4 commercial-success, 2 teleological, 2 borderline utopian, 0 survival, 0 higher-calling) is exactly what we would expect from a CPG company: heavily weighted toward operational identity and commercial outcomes, with aspirational claims kept concrete and achievable rather than epochal. The physical-chain anchoring pattern — tying AI purpose to farms, shelves, plants, and warehouses — is a distinctive CPG rhetorical signature that grounds even ambitious claims in tangible operations.\n\nA notable gap is the absence of any claims connecting AI to pep+ (PepsiCo Positive), the company's central sustainability strategy. Given that pep+ is described internally as 'our strategic end-to-end transformation that puts sustainability and human capital at the center,' the lack of AI-sustainability integration in purpose claims may represent either a genuine strategic disconnect or a rhetorical choice to keep the two transformation narratives separate. This is worth tracking in future scans."
