  "scanNotes": "Deep scan of full Cheeky Pint transcript (Dario Amodei with John Collison, published Aug 6 2025). This is one of the richest single-source purpose-claim transcripts in the collection. Amodei is unusual among tech CEOs in that he explicitly and repeatedly invokes purpose, identity, and mission to explain organizational decisions — not as window-dressing but as the actual causal mechanism for founding, hiring, retention, product prioritization, and defense contracts. The phrase 'north star' does NOT appear in this transcript. Claims cluster heavily around identity (5), direction-under-uncertainty (3), and employee-deal (2) types, with strong entries in sacrifice-justification, utopian, and transformation-framing as well. The founding narrative ('I started a company not because I was initially excited about selling things') is a clean origin-purpose claim. The 'country of geniuses in a data center' framing is used as an internal alignment device, not just external rhetoric.",
