    "keyFindings": [
      "Nike presents a striking CEO-CTO rhetorical split: Hill speaks exclusively in identity/sport language with zero AI references, while Dogan and the tech team articulate all AI-specific claims. This is among the most extreme division of rhetorical labor in the collection.",
      "Hill's purpose rhetoric actively de-emphasizes technology -- his 'we lost our obsession with sport' diagnosis implies the Donahoe era's digital-first strategy WAS the problem, making AI subordinate to sport identity.",
      "Dogan's AI claims are consistently framed as serving consumers and athletes rather than as organizational transformation -- every NikeAI quote references 'athletes,' 'consumers,' or 'Nike's DNA,' never technology for its own sake.",
      "The December 2025 elimination of the standalone CTO role (Dogan departed) and movement of tech under the COO is the structural manifestation of Hill's rhetorical de-emphasis of technology as a separate strategic function.",
      "No utopian, teleological, or higher-calling claims were found in the AI context. Nike's AI rhetoric is entirely identity + commercial-success, with two survival-adjacent claims from mid-level tech leaders."
    ],
    "rhetoricalPatterns": [
      "Sport-Identity Shield: Hill uses sport/athlete identity as a rhetorical shield that makes technology invisible -- AI is only legitimate insofar as it serves athlete outcomes, never as a transformation narrative in its own right.",
      "Consumer-Pull Framing: Dogan consistently frames AI as responding to consumer behavior changes rather than as Nike imposing technology solutions, making AI adoption feel organic rather than strategic.",
      "DNA Authentication: The repeated invocation of 'Nike's DNA' positions AI as something Nike uniquely shapes rather than something that shapes Nike -- the organization's identity is the fixed point, not the technology.",
      "Rhetorical Division of Labor: The CEO handles identity/purpose/mission, the CTO handles AI/technology specifics. Neither crosses into the other's domain, creating a two-voice system where AI is structurally subordinated in the leadership narrative."
    ],
    "comparativeNotes": "Nike's AI rhetoric stands out for what the CEO does NOT say. Unlike Bourla at Pfizer (who places himself at the center of AI narratives), Nadella at Microsoft (who frames AI as civilizational), or Pichai at Google (who leads with AI-first identity), Hill completely avoids AI language. This is the inverse of the CEO-as-AI-champion pattern seen in most specimens. The closest parallel may be traditional industrial companies where the CEO speaks to mission while the CTO handles technology specifics, but Nike is distinctive because the de-emphasis of technology appears to be a deliberate corrective after the Donahoe era's digital-first strategy was perceived as having failed. Dogan's rhetoric, while competent and commercially grounded, lacks the transformational ambition seen in CTOs at companies where AI is central to identity (e.g., Roche's Aviv Regev). The elimination of the CTO role in December 2025 suggests that even this modest AI voice has been structurally silenced at the C-suite level.",
    "notableAbsences": "Complete absence of utopian, teleological, and higher-calling claims in the AI context. No CEO-level AI rhetoric at all. No claims about AI transforming the workforce, society, or Nike's fundamental business model. No Alan John (CDAIO) quotes found despite being a key structural role -- he appears to have zero public-facing AI rhetoric. No earnings call AI mentions found (the Q1 FY2026 call transcript was inaccessible but search results suggest AI was not a discussion topic).",
    "correctedLeaderInfo": "Muge Erdirik Dogan departed Nike in December 2025 when the CTO role was eliminated. Her title should be listed as 'former EVP & CTO (departed Dec 2025)'. Jason Loveland (VP of AI) also departed in 2025. Current AI leadership is Alan John (CDAIO) and technology now reports to COO Venky Alagirisamy.",

  "scanNarrative": "The Nike scan reveals one of the most analytically interesting patterns in the collection: a CEO who speaks entirely in identity and sport language with zero AI references, paired with a CTO (now departed) who articulates all AI claims but carefully subordinates them to the sport/athlete identity. This is the inverse of the typical CEO-as-AI-champion pattern.\n\nElliott Hill's rhetoric is diagnostic: he frames Nike's recent struggles as an identity crisis ('we lost our obsession with sport') rather than a technology gap. His innovation definition ('the best innovation comes from an athlete') actively excludes technology-first framing. His personal narrative ('irrational love for Nike') authenticates his authority to redirect the company away from the Donahoe era's digital obsession. Notably, Hill makes no AI claims at all -- not even the standard 'AI will help us serve customers better' framing that most CEOs deploy.\n\nMuge Erdirik Dogan's NikeAI claims are competent but carefully constrained. Every AI reference is anchored to consumers, athletes, or 'Nike's DNA.' She frames AI adoption as following consumer behavior ('from keywords to problems to be solved') rather than as organizational transformation. The internal AI deployment quote ('freeing teams to focus on what matters most') implicitly subordinates AI to mission-critical sport work.\n\nThe structural story is as revealing as the rhetoric: the elimination of the standalone CTO role in December 2025, with technology moving under the COO, is the organizational equivalent of Hill's rhetorical de-emphasis of technology. AI at Nike is being repositioned as operational infrastructure, not strategic identity. The complete absence of public-facing quotes from Alan John (CDAIO) despite his prominent role is itself a signal -- Nike's AI leadership has gone quiet at precisely the moment other companies are loudly proclaiming AI transformation narratives.\n\nSix URLs were successfully fetched out of 14 attempted (many JS-rendered or paywalled). The richest source was The Stack's coverage of NikeAI, which yielded quotes from Dogan, Loveland, and Barman. The Nike earnings call transcript was inaccessible in readable form, which is a gap -- though search results suggest AI was not a significant discussion topic on the Q1 FY2026 call."
