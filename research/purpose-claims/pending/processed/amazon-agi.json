      "text": "It's not financially driven, not AI-driven... it's culture.",
      "speaker": "Andy Jassy",
      "speakerTitle": "CEO, Amazon",
      "context": "Public statement explaining the rationale for Amazon's first wave of ~14,000 corporate layoffs in October 2025. Jassy explicitly denied that the cuts were cost- or AI-driven, framing them as a cultural correction for having 'grew too fast.'",
      "rhetoricalFunction": "Classic sacrifice-justification with a twist: Jassy acknowledges the pain of 14K cuts but attributes it to cultural excess rather than AI displacement. This is purpose language doing deflection work -- by framing layoffs as 'culture,' Jassy avoids the politically toxic framing of 'AI is replacing your job.' The claim also functions as identity: Amazon's Day 1 culture demands leanness, and the cuts restore that identity. The analytical tension is sharp: he separately acknowledges AI will reduce headcount (see amazon-agi--004), making this a managed contradiction.",

This is the most important claim in the Amazon set because of the Jassy Contradiction: he says 'not AI-driven' here but separately says AI efficiency gains will reduce headcount (amazon-agi--004).

      "context": "Official statement from Amazon's HR leadership regarding the second wave of ~16,000 corporate layoffs in January 2026. Frames the cuts as continuation of organizational strengthening initiative announced in October 2025.",
      "rhetoricalFunction": "Pure identity claim: defines Amazon's organizational ideal as flat, ownership-driven, and anti-bureaucratic. The three-part formula ('reducing layers, increasing ownership, removing bureaucracy') is doing heavy organizational work -- it converts mass layoffs into a positive narrative about restoring Amazon's cultural DNA. 'Increasing ownership' specifically invokes Amazon's Leadership Principle, making this a claim about returning to who Amazon truly is, not about becoming something new.",

Compare with Zuckerberg's 'flattening teams' (meta-ai--005) -- convergent Big Tech language on management compression. The 'increasing ownership' phrase maps directly to Amazon's Leadership Principles, making this both a structural claim and a cultural identity claim."

      "rhetoricalFunction": "The two-word version is analytically important because of its starkness. This is identity reduced to its absolute minimum: not 'we're transforming,' not 'AI demands change,' not 'markets require efficiency' -- just 'culture.' The claim does maximum deflection work in minimum words. When a CEO uses two words to explain 30,000 layoffs, the economy of language is itself a data point.",

      "rhetoricalFunction": "Direction-under-uncertainty: Jassy is signaling a future state ('in coming years') where AI-driven efficiency reduces headcount, without specifying timeline, magnitude, or which functions. This is the contradictory partner to amazon-agi--001: there, he says cuts are 'not AI-driven'; here, he says AI will drive future cuts. The managed contradiction serves different audiences -- employees (not your fault) vs. investors (we're getting more efficient).",

Jassy hedges where Zuckerberg is direct. IMPORTANT: This quote may be a close paraphrase rather than exact verbatim -- our research notes record it in quotation marks but it reads as reported speech.

The double negative ('not trying to create') is weaker than a positive promise ('we will not cut further'), leaving maximum flexibility.
