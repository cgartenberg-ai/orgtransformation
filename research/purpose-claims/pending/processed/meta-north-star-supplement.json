  "rescanNotes": "No live web searches were possible. This file should be treated as a local-data-only scan. A rescan with web access is recommended to search for: (1) Alexandr Wang 'north star' quotes from MSL announcements or interviews, (2) Chris Cox or Andrew Bosworth 'north star' quotes from product keynotes or podcasts, (3) Any Zuckerberg 'north star' usage in contexts beyond Q4 2025 earnings (e.g., shareholder letters, Connect keynotes, internal memos leaked to press). Priority: HIGH for rescan when web tools are available."
