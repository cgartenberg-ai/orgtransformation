      "speakerTitle": "Company statement",
      "context": "Official statement at the launch of the AI CIC (Company-in-Company) in September 2025, defining the new unit's role within the broader SK Group conglomerate. The AI CIC consolidates all AI functions under CEO Ryu Young-sang with KRW 5 trillion ($3.6B) committed over 5 years.",
      "rhetoricalFunction": "Organizational identity claim that positions the AI CIC not merely as an internal business unit but as the conglomerate-wide AI leadership entity. The phrase 'core that leads' stakes a claim to centrality — this is not a supporting function or an experiment, but the nucleus of AI for the entire SK Group. The escalation from 'main driver of SK's AI business' to 'the core that leads the AI business for the entire SK Group' performs a scope expansion: what starts as an SKT initiative is framed as group-level leadership.",

      "context": "Town hall meeting with employees marking the one-year anniversary of Ryu's inauguration (approximately late 2023 or early 2024). Ryu framing SKT's transformation from telecom to AI company while retaining telecommunications as the foundation.",
      "rhetoricalFunction": "Transformation-framing that navigates the tension between legacy and future. 'SKT's version of a distinguished AI company' asserts uniqueness — not just any AI company, but one built on telecom DNA. 'Based on our main business of telecommunications' anchors the transformation in existing competency rather than abandoning it. This is organizational identity preservation through transformation: we become AI, but we don't stop being telecom. The word 'leap' signals discontinuous change, not gradual evolution.",

Ryu is trying to thread the needle of radical transformation without identity abandonment."

      "context": "September 25, 2025 company-wide town hall meeting announcing the AI CIC launch. Ryu framing the current moment as an unprecedented opportunity that justifies the $3.6B AI investment and organizational restructuring.",
      "rhetoricalFunction": "Utopian framing that uses the 'golden era' metaphor to convert uncertainty into opportunity. The phrase implies that this is a historically unique window — golden eras are temporary, which creates urgency. If you don't act now, the golden era passes. This is purpose as temporal framing: the AI CIC isn't just a strategic choice, it's a response to a once-in-a-generation moment. The utopian element is that AI is framed as fundamentally generative rather than disruptive.",

      "notes": "Short fragment. The 'golden era' framing is characteristically different from Western CEO rhetoric — Benioff says 'revolution,' Zuckerberg says 'new era,' Ryu says 'golden era.' Each temporal metaphor carries different connotations: revolution implies disruption, new era implies beginning, golden era implies peak opportunity."

      "rhetoricalFunction": "Identity claim that defines SKT through customer trust rather than technology or market position. This is notable because it was delivered in the context of a data breach crisis — the identity claim is doing repair work, not transformation work. The phrase 'has been and will be' asserts temporal continuity: trust was always central and will remain so, even through the AI transformation. This anchors the AI CIC in an existing value (trust) rather than a new one (AI leadership).",

Unlike other specimens where identity claims authorize transformation, here the identity claim constrains transformation — AI innovation must not compromise customer trust. This is purpose as guardrail rather than purpose as accelerant."

      "rhetoricalFunction": "Direction-under-uncertainty from a new CEO establishing legitimacy by naming what the old approach got wrong. 'Old ways of thinking' is an implicit critique of the predecessor's approach — or at least of organizational inertia. The claim sets direction by elimination (not harder, not old ways) rather than prescription (here's the new way). The humility is notable: Jung described himself as a 'Chief Change Officer' and promised 'management will take responsibility for failures.' This is direction-setting through institutional humility.",

Two CEOs, two registers, one transformation. Compare with the Zuckerberg/Wang rhetorical division at Meta — but here the division is temporal (predecessor vs. successor) rather than simultaneous (CEO vs. CAIO)."
