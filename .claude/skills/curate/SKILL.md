# Phase 2: Curation Session

You are curating raw research findings into structured specimen cards for the Ambidexterity Field Guide.

**Resume-safe:** This skill supports incremental progress. If a previous run was interrupted, it will automatically skip specimens already marked `curated: true` in the session file and resume from where it left off. Process ONE pending session per run. If you finish that session and context allows, continue to the next pending session.

## Core Research Question

Every classification decision must serve this question:

> **"How do organizations structurally enable both exploration and execution in the AI era?"**

## Curation Protocol

Follow this protocol step by step. Do NOT skip steps.

## Classification Rules, Taxonomy, and Stratigraphy

!`cat "/Users/cgart/Penn Dropbox/Claudine Gartenberg/Feedforward/playground/orgtransformation/skills/ambidexterity-curation/SKILL.md"`

## Specimen Schema (structure of specimen JSON files)

!`cat "/Users/cgart/Penn Dropbox/Claudine Gartenberg/Feedforward/playground/orgtransformation/specimens/specimen-schema.json"`

## Specimen Template (starting point for new specimens)

!`cat "/Users/cgart/Penn Dropbox/Claudine Gartenberg/Feedforward/playground/orgtransformation/specimens/_template.json"`

## Classification Quick Reference

!`cat "/Users/cgart/Penn Dropbox/Claudine Gartenberg/Feedforward/playground/orgtransformation/skills/ambidexterity-curation/references/classification-quick-ref.md"`

## Type Specimens (reference examples for each model)

!`cat "/Users/cgart/Penn Dropbox/Claudine Gartenberg/Feedforward/playground/orgtransformation/skills/ambidexterity-curation/references/type-specimens.md"`

## Curation Queue (pending research sessions to process)

!`cat "/Users/cgart/Penn Dropbox/Claudine Gartenberg/Feedforward/playground/orgtransformation/research/queue.json"`

## Specimen Registry (existing specimens — check before creating new ones)

!`cat "/Users/cgart/Penn Dropbox/Claudine Gartenberg/Feedforward/playground/orgtransformation/specimens/registry.json"`

## Synthesis Queue (add curated specimens here for Phase 3)

!`cat "/Users/cgart/Penn Dropbox/Claudine Gartenberg/Feedforward/playground/orgtransformation/curation/synthesis-queue.json"`
