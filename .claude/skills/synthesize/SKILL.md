# Phase 3: Synthesis Session

You are synthesizing curated specimens into cross-cutting patterns for the Ambidexterity Field Guide.

## Core Research Question

Every pattern you identify must connect to this question:

> **"How do organizations structurally enable both exploration and execution in the AI era?"**

## Synthesis Protocol

Follow this protocol step by step. Do NOT skip steps.

!`cat "/Users/cgart/Penn Dropbox/Claudine Gartenberg/Feedforward/playground/orgtransformation/synthesis/SYNTHESIS-PROTOCOL.md"`

## Synthesis Domain Knowledge (what to look for, quality standards, output formats)

!`cat "/Users/cgart/Penn Dropbox/Claudine Gartenberg/Feedforward/playground/orgtransformation/skills/ambidexterity-synthesis/SKILL.md"`

## Synthesis Queue (specimens to process)

!`cat "/Users/cgart/Penn Dropbox/Claudine Gartenberg/Feedforward/playground/orgtransformation/curation/synthesis-queue.json"`

## Current Mechanisms (update with new evidence)

!`cat "/Users/cgart/Penn Dropbox/Claudine Gartenberg/Feedforward/playground/orgtransformation/synthesis/mechanisms.json"`

## Current Tensions (update with new evidence)

!`cat "/Users/cgart/Penn Dropbox/Claudine Gartenberg/Feedforward/playground/orgtransformation/synthesis/tensions.json"`

## Current Contingencies (update with new evidence)

!`cat "/Users/cgart/Penn Dropbox/Claudine Gartenberg/Feedforward/playground/orgtransformation/synthesis/contingencies.json"`

## Current Insights (archived v1 collection — update with new evidence, NEVER delete)

!`cat "/Users/cgart/Penn Dropbox/Claudine Gartenberg/Feedforward/playground/orgtransformation/synthesis/insights.json"`

## Analytical Primitives (5 primitives that predict structural choice — use as lens, not filter)

!`cat "/Users/cgart/Penn Dropbox/Claudine Gartenberg/Feedforward/playground/orgtransformation/synthesis/primitives.json"`

## Core Findings (10 consolidated findings — evaluate evidence for/against in Step 5d)

!`cat "/Users/cgart/Penn Dropbox/Claudine Gartenberg/Feedforward/playground/orgtransformation/synthesis/findings.json"`

## Field Signals (macro observations from research sessions — check for promotion to insights)

!`cat "/Users/cgart/Penn Dropbox/Claudine Gartenberg/Feedforward/playground/orgtransformation/research/field-signals.json"`

## Specimen Registry (for cross-referencing)

!`cat "/Users/cgart/Penn Dropbox/Claudine Gartenberg/Feedforward/playground/orgtransformation/specimens/registry.json"`
