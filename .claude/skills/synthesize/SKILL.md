# Phase 3: Synthesis Session

You are synthesizing curated specimens into cross-cutting patterns for the Ambidexterity Field Guide.

## Core Research Question

Every pattern you identify must connect to this question:

> **"How do organizations structurally enable both exploration and execution in the AI era?"**

## Synthesis Protocol

Follow this protocol step by step. Do NOT skip steps.

!`cat "/Users/cgart/Penn Dropbox/Claudine Gartenberg/Feedforward/playground/orgtransformation/synthesis/SYNTHESIS-PROTOCOL.md"`

## Synthesis Domain Knowledge (what to look for, quality standards, output formats)

!`cat "/Users/cgart/Penn Dropbox/Claudine Gartenberg/Feedforward/playground/orgtransformation/skills/ambidexterity-synthesis/SKILL.md"`

## Synthesis Queue (specimens to process)

!`cat "/Users/cgart/Penn Dropbox/Claudine Gartenberg/Feedforward/playground/orgtransformation/curation/synthesis-queue.json"`

## Current Mechanisms (update with new evidence)

!`cat "/Users/cgart/Penn Dropbox/Claudine Gartenberg/Feedforward/playground/orgtransformation/synthesis/mechanisms.json"`

## Current Tensions (update with new evidence)

!`cat "/Users/cgart/Penn Dropbox/Claudine Gartenberg/Feedforward/playground/orgtransformation/synthesis/tensions.json"`

## Current Contingencies (update with new evidence)

!`cat "/Users/cgart/Penn Dropbox/Claudine Gartenberg/Feedforward/playground/orgtransformation/synthesis/contingencies.json"`

## Current Insights (update with new evidence, add new insights — NEVER delete existing insights)

!`cat "/Users/cgart/Penn Dropbox/Claudine Gartenberg/Feedforward/playground/orgtransformation/synthesis/insights.json"`

## Specimen Registry (for cross-referencing)

!`cat "/Users/cgart/Penn Dropbox/Claudine Gartenberg/Feedforward/playground/orgtransformation/specimens/registry.json"`
