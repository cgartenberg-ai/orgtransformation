---

| Date | What Changed |
|------|-------------|
| 2026-02-01 | Created APP_STATE.md. Site prototype reviewed — all 10 routes working, Phases 1-3 of UI Spec implemented. |
| 2026-02-01 | Created session bootstrap system: CLAUDE.md (auto-read entry point), SW_ARCHITECTURE.md (detailed site architecture), updated APP_STATE.md with cross-references. HANDOFF.md superseded. |
| 2026-02-01 | **Phase 1 Research**: Session 001 — press+podcast+report scan. Found 6 orgs (IndoStar, NTT DATA, Invent, UPS evolution, Microsoft evolution, PwC). **Phase 2 Curation**: Created 4 new specimens (IndoStar, NTT DATA, Invent, PwC), updated 2 (UPS, Microsoft). Total specimens: 84. **Phase 3 Synthesis**: Processed all 6 — updated mechanisms #5, #8, #9, #10; added Microsoft to candidate "AI-Driven Restructuring" (8 specimens); convergent delayering pattern (UPS+MSFT); Model 2 sub-types proposed. Synthesis queue: 0 pending. |
| 2026-02-01 | **Phase 1 Research**: Session 002 — first-ever scan of 6 Tier 1 press sources (WSJ, FT, Reuters, Bloomberg, The Information, LinkedIn). Found 4 orgs (UBS CAIO evolution, CBA CAIO evolution, Stagwell new, Amazon evolution). Ad agency CAIO wave documented. Deep-scan backlog consolidated. Curation queue: 4 orgs pending. |
| 2026-02-01 | **UI Sprint Planning**: Created UI_IMPROVEMENTS.md (8-item prioritized backlog from full site walkthrough). Created HOME_PAGE_REDESIGN.md (detailed design spec for home page: hero rewrite, 7 species cards, type specimen showcase, rotating field observation). Created HANDOFF_UI_SPRINT.md. Global terminology decision: "Mechanisms" → "Patterns" (UI text only, not routes/code). Fixed stale dev server 404s (restart resolved). |
| 2026-02-01 | **UI Sprint Implementation**: Home page redesign (5-section layout), terminology rename (Mechanisms→Patterns→Principles), evolution tab reframe (stratigraphic→organizational evolution), species descriptions on specimens page, Claude API conversational matcher (streaming chat with sessionStorage). 20 modified + 5 new files. |
| 2026-02-01 | **Taxonomy Audit**: Reclassified 4 specimens (Samsung C-Lab M7→M5a, Eli Lilly M1→M4, Roche-Genentech M1→M3, Intercom Temporal→Contextual). Added 7 classification guardrails to curation protocol. Added M8 Skunkworks as emerging model. Tagged 10 AI-native specimens. Created low-confidence research queue. Added clickable taxonomy tags + model/orientation detail pages. Committed as 81b4bb0. |
| 2026-02-02 | **Curation**: Processed research session 002 (UBS, Commonwealth Bank, Amazon enrichments + Stagwell new specimen). Total specimens: 85. |
| 2026-02-02 | **Synthesis**: Processed 18 pending specimens. Promoted 2 candidate mechanisms to confirmed: #11 "AI-Driven Workforce Restructuring" (8 specimens), #12 "Business Leader as AI Chief" (3 specimens). Full Stagwell analysis across all synthesis dimensions. All queues now empty (0 pending). Updated mechanisms (12 confirmed), tensions (5), contingencies (5). |
| 2026-02-02 | **Handoff Updates**: Updated Ambidexterity_Field_Guide_Spec.md (v1.2), APP_STATE.md, HANDOFF_UI_SPRINT.md (archived), HANDOFF.md for session continuity. |
| 2026-02-02 | **Visual Design Spec**: Created VISUAL_DESIGN_SPEC.md (Digital Nature Documentary direction — procedural organisms, terrain tension map, geological timeline, 3D ecosystem). Created STRUCTURAL_IMPROVEMENTS_PLAN.md for 4 near-term improvements. |
| 2026-02-02 | **4 Structural Improvements Implemented**: (1) AI-native visibility: M8 Skunkworks added to all taxonomy constants/filters/colors, new `/ai-native` page + nav link. (2) Taxonomy enrichment: ModelAccordion and OrientationAccordion components with characteristics, sub-types, type specimens, orientation distribution, related mechanisms; 3 key insight callouts on taxonomy page. (3) Mechanism-taxonomy cross-linking: computed affinity profiles for all 12 mechanisms (`scripts/compute-mechanism-affinity.js`), surfaced on mechanisms list/detail pages, model/orientation detail pages. (4) Tensions enrichment: added drivers, connected contingencies, interpretive notes to all 5 tensions; tensions page shows model clustering per pole, drivers section, linked contingencies, interpretive notes; TensionMap hover shows position value, model name, pole label. Build verified — 121 pages. |
| 2026-02-03 | **M9 AI-Native as Structural Model**: Promoted AI-Native from orgType tag to full structural model M9. Taxonomy now 9 models × 3 orientations. Reclassified 10 AI-native specimens (ami-labs, databricks, glean, harvey-ai, mercor, sierra-ai, snowflake, ssi, thinking-machines-lab, world-labs) from their previous models (M1/M3/M4/M5) to M9. Updated all type definitions, taxonomy constants, MODEL_NUMBERS, TensionMap colors, hardcoded model arrays (6 files), home page ("Nine Structural Species"), SpecimenBrowser, model detail pages, matcher prompt. Recomputed mechanism affinity profiles. Updated AI-native page to reference M9. Build verified — 122 pages. |
| 2026-02-03 | **UX Fixes & Insight System Enhancements**: (1) TensionMap bug fix: `hoveredValue.toFixed is not a function` — changed null check to `typeof === "number"`. (2) TensionMap readability: wider padding, pole labels with directional arrows outside chart, background color zones, scale markers. (3) Nav simplified: removed Matcher and AI-Native links; final nav: Specimens, Taxonomy, Principles, Insights, Tensions, Compare, About. (4) Insight improvements: cross-references on specimen detail pages, maturity lifecycle (hypothesis→emerging→confirmed), synthesis skill integration (Step 5b in protocol), research target flags on insights page. (5) Insights guardrail added to CLAUDE.md settled decisions. (6) Spec documents updated; NARRATIVE_SPEC.md created for insight-driven narrative creation workflow. |
| 2026-02-03 | **Intellectual Rigor Overhaul**: (1) Mechanism audit: demoted #2, #9, #12 to candidate; renamed #8 to "Turn Compliance Into Deployment Advantage"; split #11 into delayering mechanism + headcount candidate; added maturity lifecycle (emerging/confirmed/widespread/deprecated); result: 9 confirmed mechanisms, 9 candidates. (2) Cross-cutting insights: created synthesis/insights.json with 13 field insights; new /insights page + nav link; top 6 insights on home page. (3) Specimen schema: added secondary models to 6 multi-model specimens (accenture-openai, bcg-trailblazers, salesforce, microsoft, nvidia, jpmorgan). (4) Theoretical grounding: added scholarlyAnchor to all 9 confirmed mechanisms connecting to March, Simon, Arrow, Holmstrom, Henderson/Clark, Eisenhardt, Gibbons/Henderson; rewrote theoreticalConnection fields as crisp one-sentence summaries. Build verified — 120 pages. |
| 2026-02-03 | **Field Insight Refinements**: (1) Reframed hub-and-spoke insight: "regulated industries" → "R&D-intensive industries"; driver is specialization/local knowledge (Garicano 2000), not regulation per se; flagged that all 5 specimens are pharma so can't yet distinguish. (2) Killed isomorphism framing: restructuring insight reframed as convergent response to common technological shock (Simon), not DiMaggio & Powell mimetic isomorphism; "redundancy washing" kept as honest counter-explanation. (3) CAIO waves: replaced isomorphism with information cascades (Banerjee 1992) — rational updating under uncertainty, not blind copying. (4) Terminology: "research insights" → "field insights" across all files. (5) Added collaboration mode to CLAUDE.md: org econ identity, two-hat workflow. |
| 2026-02-03 | **Field Signal Infrastructure**: Created `research/field-signals.json` — structured registry for macro observations across research sessions. 20 signals backfilled from 9 past sessions. Updated SESSION-PROTOCOL.md + research SKILL.md to institutionalize signal tracking. Signal lifecycle: active → saturated → promoted. |
| 2026-02-03 | **3 Research Sessions**: Session 1 (podcasts/press/substacks): SK Telecom CIC, Pentagon CDAO, NY State CAIO, Meta evolution, Microsoft evolution. Session 2 (AI labs/press): Meta MSL 5th restructuring (Wang CAIO, 4-unit structure, LeCun departure), AMI Labs (LeCun venture), Pinterest 15% AI pivot cuts, Infosys 100K Cursor CoE, Anthropic IPO prep ($350B, LTBT governance). Session 3 (earnings calls): Microsoft (-$375B correction, $37.5B CapEx, 15M Copilot seats), Meta ($115-135B 2026 CapEx, "single talented person" replaces teams), Amazon (30K cuts, Jassy contradiction), Salesforce (Agentforce $500M ARR, 84% resolution, 4K redeployed), Google (Gemini 650M MAU, Cloud $155B backlog). Earnings calls elevated to Tier 1. CIO Dive added as source. Total: 44 sources (19 Tier 1, 25 Tier 2). 22 field signals tracked. 3 sessions pending curation. |
| 2026-02-03 | **Earnings Season Protocol**: Built structured earnings call research infrastructure. Created `research/earnings-calendar.json` with 15 target companies (fiscal year mappings, priorities, scan history, keyword protocol). Updated SESSION-PROTOCOL.md with full Earnings Season Protocol section (per-company scan process, keyword categories, why earnings are special). Added `earnings` session type. Google Q4 (Feb 4) and Amazon Q4 (Feb 5) pending. |
| 2026-02-04 | **Earnings Wide-Net Research Session**: First dedicated earnings discovery session using new protocol. Found 7 orgs: Travelers (TravAI agentic AI, 20K users, 30% handle time reduction — insurance structural goldmine), ServiceNow (AI Control Tower, $600M Now Assist, McDermott "obliterate org charts"), Accenture ($865M restructuring, 11K layoffs, "exiting non-reskillable"), Nokia (Defense incubation unit — M8 candidate, €750M restructuring), Workday (1,750 layoffs — AI-washing data point), Publicis (CoreAI, 73% AI-powered), RWJBarnabas Health (healthcare AI CoE, 14 hospitals). Google Q4 and Amazon Q4 transcripts pending (calls today/tomorrow). Added Travelers + ServiceNow to earnings calendar. 2 new field signals (insurance-as-goldmine, agentic-as-restructuring-tool). 25 total field signals. 4 sessions pending curation (23 orgs total). |
| 2026-02-04 | **Parallel Curation of 4 Research Sessions**: First parallel curation session — 4 background agents curated 4 research sessions simultaneously. Updated curation protocol with "Parallel Curation with Overlapping Specimens" section. Created `scripts/rebuild-registry.js`. **8 new specimens**: sk-telecom (M5), pentagon-cdao (M4), new-york-state (M2), travelers (M4), servicenow (M4), nokia (M4), workday (M6a Stub), rwjbarnabas-health (M2 Stub — first healthcare system specimen). **12 specimens updated**: meta-ai (major evolution: MSL 4-unit structure, 7 layers, 28 sources, completeness→High), microsoft, ami-labs, pinterest, infosys, anthropic, amazon-agi, google-deepmind, salesforce, accenture-openai (reclassified M2→M4), publicis-groupe (reclassified M2→M4), eli-lilly (confirmed current). **Total specimens: 93** (was 85). 19 specimens pending synthesis. Validator: 0 errors, 63 warnings. |
| 2026-02-04 | **Batched Synthesis (19 specimens)**: Manual 3-batch synthesis to avoid `/synthesize` skill context overflow. Batch 1 (meta-ai, travelers, servicenow, accenture-openai, publicis-groupe, nokia): M11 promoted to confirmed (6 specimens); added Nokia to M1, ServiceNow to M10, Accenture to candidate. Batch 2 (sk-telecom, pentagon-cdao, microsoft, amazon-agi, google-deepmind, salesforce): added SK Telecom + Pentagon CDAO to M6 (now 7 specimens); consolidation pattern extends beyond Big Tech. Batch 3 (anthropic, ami-labs, pinterest, infosys, new-york-state, workday, rwjbarnabas-health): government CAIO wave documented. **Insight promotions**: `regulation-expensive-not-slow` emerging→confirmed (Travelers); `entry-level-talent-hollow` emerging→confirmed (Accenture); `meta-exploration-failure` hypothesis→emerging. **Insight updates**: management-delayering +3, ai-restructuring +4, ai-team-consolidation +2, caio-waves +2, consulting-dual-identity +1. All 19 specimens placed in tensions + contingencies. Synthesis queue: 0 pending. |
| 2026-02-03 | **Travelers Reclassified M4→M2**: TravAI is a central platform with business units as consumers (unidirectional enablement). No evidence of spoke-level AI development capacity — CoE, not hub-and-spoke. Confidence downgraded High→Medium. M4 count drops by 1 (to 27), M2 gains 1 (to 18). Synthesis files not yet updated for reclassification. |
| 2026-02-03 | **Purpose Claims Skill**: Created `/purpose-claims` skill for systematically searching for verbatim purpose claims by leaders at specimen organizations, made in the context of AI adaptation. 6 claim types: utopian, identity, transformation-framing, employee-deal, sacrifice-justification, direction-under-uncertainty. Created: `.claude/skills/purpose-claims/SKILL.md` (full protocol with same source registry as `/research`), `research/purpose-claims/registry.json` (empty, with schema), `research/purpose-claims/scan-tracker.json` (93 specimens, all unscanned), `research/purpose-claims/sessions/` (empty). Quality filters: verbatim-only, AI-adaptation context required, source URL required. Serves the purpose × AI transformation paper. |
| 2026-02-03 | **Literature Matching System**: Created LITERATURE_SPEC.md — full spec for connecting field observations to scholarly conversation. Design principle: loose coupling (literature analysis decoupled from fieldwork pipeline to prevent confirmation bias). Three research modes: broad sweeps (default), low-confidence targets (existing), literature gap targets (new). Registry schema with `keyMechanism`, `predictionForAI`, relationship types (confirms/extends/boundary-condition/contradicts). Created `research/literature/registry.json` with 17 core canon entries (Garicano, March, Simon, Arrow, Holmstrom, Aghion & Tirole, Gibbons & Henderson, Henderson & Clark, Teece, Christensen, O'Reilly & Tushman, Gibson & Birkinshaw, North, Banerjee, Becker, Dessein, Alonso Dessein & Matouschek). Created `research/literature-gaps-queue.json` stub. Added LITERATURE_SPEC.md to CLAUDE.md Required Reading. |
| 2026-02-03 | **Purpose Claims Batch 1 + Transcript Gap Protocol**: Scanned 7 specimens for purpose claims using parallel background agents. Results: Meta 11 (pilot), Microsoft 15 (7 web + 8 transcript), Anthropic 14 (transcript-only — the motherlode), Eli Lilly 7 (0 web → 7 transcript — proved transcript gap is real), Shopify 5, Amazon 5, ServiceNow 2. **59 total claims** in registry across 7 specimens. Claim type distribution: identity 29%, direction-under-uncertainty 20%, employee-deal 19%, transformation-framing 12%, utopian 10%, sacrifice-justification 10%. **Transcript gap discovery**: web search systematically underrepresents identity and direction-under-uncertainty claims. Eli Lilly went 0→7 with transcript access. **Protocol updates**: Added `transcriptsAvailable: true` to 7 podcast sources in source-registry.json (Cheeky Pint, Dwarkesh, Latent Space, Acquired, Conversations with Tyler, Lex Fridman, Cognitive Revolution). Updated SKILL.md with 7-source transcript list + deep-scan guidance. Updated SESSION-PROTOCOL.md with transcript check step. Created `research/transcript-gap-queue.json` with 10 known specimen×transcript pairs. Added "north star" to standard search queries (only Zuckerberg uses it — not convergent). Updated analytical-notes.md with 9 patterns, 4 hypotheses. |
| 2026-02-06 | **Purpose Claims Spec + Transcript Discovery Protocol + WORKFLOW.md**: (1) Created `research/purpose-claims/PURPOSE-CLAIMS-SPEC.md` — comprehensive data layer spec. 7-type taxonomy (added `teleological` for Dario/Demis-style outcome-anchored claims). Taxonomy evolution protocol (flag edge cases → quarterly review → revise when 5+ share fit problem). Claim schema with new fields: secondaryType, taxonomyFlag, transcriptSource, rhetoricalFunction. Updated registry.json with taxonomyVersion 1.0. (2) Designed + implemented Transcript Discovery Protocol: `research/transcript-sources.json` (13 seed sources: 7 podcasts, 2 earnings, 1 congressional, 3 YouTube manual-required). Expanded `research/transcript-gap-queue.json` schema (10 entries migrated to new format with sourceId, leaderTitle, transcriptQuality, transcriptAccess, aiRelevance, status, discoveredDate, scannedDate). Created `research/TRANSCRIPT-DISCOVERY-PROTOCOL.md` (Phase 1 quick sweep + Phase 2 deep discovery). Updated SESSION-PROTOCOL.md with Step 2b. Updated both /research and /purpose-claims skills to reference protocol. (3) Created `WORKFLOW.md` — complete command reference documenting both research tracks (structural + purpose claims), all 5 skills, transcript discovery protocol, file maps, typical session flows. Single source of truth for "how does this work?". Updated CLAUDE.md with two-track architecture, WORKFLOW.md reference, quick command table. Updated HANDOFF.md with current priorities. 10 commits total. |
| 2026-02-04 | **Purpose Claims Batch 2**: Scanned 4 specimens via foreground serial scans (background agents failed due to web permission issue — `run_in_background: true` blocks WebSearch/WebFetch). Results: Accenture 8 (Sweet: reskill-or-exit, five decades of change, courage+humility, North Star), Salesforce 10 (Benioff: digital labor revolution, last generation of CEOs, "I need less heads," Benioff Contradiction), Klarna 7 (Siemiatkowski: REVERSAL CASE — cost over quality admission, "my tech bros" anti-utopian, Brussels translator), SK Telecom 5 (Ryu: golden era, leap into AI company, CEO succession register shift). **89 total claims** in registry across 11 specimens. 5 new patterns: #10 purpose claims are context-dependent performance (Benioff podcast vs. interview), #11 reversal case (Klarna), #12 anti-utopian register (Sweet+Siemiatkowski), #13 North Star update (Sweet uses it too), #14 CEO succession changes rhetorical register (SK Telecom). New hypothesis H5: podcast contexts elicit more honest purpose claims. Updated SKILL.md with stronger agent prompt template (mandatory web search). |
| 2026-02-07 | **Purpose Claims Visual Browser**: Built full `/purpose-claims` page with two browsing modes (by-specimen, by-claim-type), sidebar filters, text search, starred claims feature (localStorage). Integrated Purpose Claims tab into specimen detail pages. **Batch 5** (google-x 14, pentagon-cdao 18, ups 14, ubs 10 = 56 claims). **Batch 6** (commonwealth-bank 13, wells-fargo 8, bank-of-america 14, pg-chatpg 9 = 44 claims). **Pentagon-CDAO removed** (18 claims deleted — political entity, not corporate). **Exploratory Visualizations**: Added Heatmap Matrix and Specimen Dot Map as new view modes. Shared claim constants extracted. |
| 2026-02-07 | **Batch 7** (databricks 14, walmart 15, moderna 12, deloitte 5 = 46 claims). Model diversification: added M9 (Databricks), M5 (Walmart), M6a (Moderna), M2 (Deloitte). **Viz toggles**: Added model/industry group-by toggle to both Heatmap and Dot Map with complementary tags. Registry now at **294 claims across 29 specimens**. Patterns #26-#30, hypothesis H8. Build verified — 129 pages. |
| 2026-02-07 | **Research Session (partial)**: Launched 4 research agents + 4 purpose claims agents (8 Opus agents simultaneously). **3 research agents completed**: Goldman Sachs deep-scan (49KB, 17 obs, 19 quotes, 8 purpose claims — OneGS 3.0, AI troika, Acceleration Team, 95% S-1 automation), Morgan Stanley deep-scan (39KB, 14 obs, 7 quotes, 5 purpose claims — Firmwide AI Head, AI Steering Group, OpenAI partnership), Podcast/Substack feed check (6/8 feeds have new content). **5 agents crashed** (general sweep + batch 8 purpose claims: nvidia, jpmorgan, duolingo, tesla) — likely context window exhaustion from 8 simultaneous Opus agents. Results in `research/pending/` awaiting processing. Lesson: max 4 agents at a time. |
| 2026-02-07 | **Massive Research Run (Session 5)**: 8 successful Opus agent runs producing 10 rich output files in `research/pending/`. Key findings: Amazon $200B CapEx, Google 50% AI-written code, Pfizer M4 confirmation, JPMorgan structural AI separation, UBS first CAIO, 3 new specimen candidates (Genpact, Cognizant, Thomson Reuters). 2 agents crashed (industrials + targeted sweep). 10 pending files still unprocessed. |
| 2026-02-08 | **Purpose Claims Taxonomy Revision (Session 6 — analytical, no code)**: Reviewed all 294 claims. Found v1.0 taxonomy mixed 3 genuine "planes of meaning" types (utopian, teleological, identity) with 4 surface-level categories. Developed v2.0: 6 types organized by what END the claim invokes. Dropped employee-deal (not purpose claims), dissolved transformation-framing/sacrifice-justification/direction-under-uncertainty, added higher-calling/survival/commercial-success. Full plan: `research/purpose-claims/TAXONOMY-REVISION-PLAN.md`. Execution pending next session. |
| 2026-02-08 | **Session 7: Taxonomy v2.0 Execution + Overnight Automation + Sector Coverage**. (1) Executed taxonomy v2.0 reclassification of all 294 claims. Updated SKILL.md agent template, PURPOSE-CLAIMS-SPEC.md, registry.json taxonomyVersion→2.0. (2) **Batch 8 purpose claims** (nvidia 19, jpmorgan 12, duolingo 12, tesla 14 = 57 claims) + Amazon test (15 claims) merged into registry. Registry now at **337 claims across 34 specimens** (35 scanned, 58 unscanned). Type distribution: identity 130, commercial-success 82, utopian 45, survival 40, teleological 28, higher-calling 12. (3) **Overnight automation scripts**: Built `scripts/overnight-purpose-claims.py` (~350 lines) and `scripts/overnight-research.py` (~400 lines) — both use `claude -p --model opus` subprocess mode for unattended sequential scanning. Purpose claims script: priority queue, auto-merge, retry logic, session logging. Research script: reads target-specimens.json, includes full 9-model taxonomy reference in prompt, outputs structured JSON. Both tested successfully (Amazon: 15 claims in 4m18s; Delta: M4, 7 quotes, 8 key people in 6m). (4) **Systematic sector coverage**: Created `research/target-specimens.json` with 37 target companies in AI Exposure × Output Type 2×2 sampling frame. Includes automotive cluster (GM, Ford, Toyota, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Honda), healthcare cluster (UnitedHealth, Mayo Clinic, CVS, Sutter Health, Mount Sinai), defense (Lockheed Martin, Anduril), semiconductors (AMD, Intel), plus industrials/energy/media/retail/logistics targets. (5) Delta Air Lines research output in `research/pending/` (11 pending files total). **Steady-state pipeline vision**: nightly automation for research discovery + purpose claims scanning; gap: automated curation and specimen refresh not yet built. |
| 2026-02-09 | **Sessions 8-10: Overnight Synthesis Pipeline Fix + Two-File Architecture**. (1) **Normalizer fixes for Batches 3-9**: Fixed `_normalize_agent_output()` in `overnight-synthesis.py` to handle 6+ format variants (specimenPositions, snake_case keys, per-tension lists, specimenQueueUpdates, proposedId placeholders). Re-merged all batches. Final state: 199/199 synthesized, 143 specimens, 9 confirmed + 14 candidate mechanisms, 36 insights. (2) **Two-File Synthesis Output Architecture**: Redesigned agent output from single JSON to two files — `batch{N}-updates.json` (rigid template, auto-merge) for existing taxonomy + `batch{N}-discoveries.json` (structured free-form, human-reviewed) for new mechanisms/tensions/insights. Templates pre-fill canonical keys so agents modify rather than generate structure. (3) **Discovery Promotion Pipeline**: New `--promote N` CLI mode merges reviewed discoveries into taxonomy — mechanism candidates and insights auto-merge, tension/taxonomy proposals logged as "ACTION REQUIRED" for manual review. (4) **Backup/Rollback**: Pre-merge backup of all 5 synthesis files to `synthesis/pending/backups/pre-batch{N}/`, automatic rollback on crash, post-merge JSON validation. (5) **Normalizer Metrics**: Tracks normalization effort per category (key_remappings, mechanism_fixes, tension_fixes, contingency_fixes, insight_fixes, queue_fixes) — with template approach, expect near-zero. All changes tested end-to-end: syntax ✅, template generation ✅, normalizer on template ✅, backup/restore ✅, promote pipeline ✅, validator 0 errors. |
| 2026-02-09 | **Sessions 11-12: Interactive Synthesis — Batches 1-4 (41 specimens placed)**. Pivotal sessions that proved synthesis CANNOT be automated. (1) **Batch 1** (13 Big Tech/AI-native): JPMorgan fixed (was missing T4/C2-C5). All 13 synced to central arrays. (2) **Batch 2** (8 financial/pharma): bank-of-america, wells-fargo, ubs, eli-lilly, moderna, novo-nordisk, pfizer, roche-genentech. Discovered mRNA-AI modularity connection → Nadella Coase reference → `modularity-predicts-ai-structure` hypothesis added to insights.json. (3) **Batch 3** (6 services/mixed): unitedhealth-group, accenture, cognizant, genpact, sanofi, infosys. UnitedHealth "scale without signal" observation; IT services divergence pattern. (4) **Batch 4** (13 automotive/industrial): bmw, mercedes-benz, toyota, honda, ford, general-motors, tesla, hyundai-robotics, bosch-bcai, deere-and-co, honeywell, dow-chemical, exxonmobil. **Key discoveries**: Automotive M4 convergence (10/13 specimens), GM CAIO failure as natural experiment, "data foundation first" sequencing pattern, Tesla "quiet by integration" (T4=+0.5 — AI IS the product so no branding needed), Physical AI as distinct M1 variant (Hyundai). (5) **Protocol overhaul**: Deprecated automated `/synthesize` and `overnight-synthesis.py`. Replaced with Interactive Botanist Mode in WORKFLOW.md — full scoring guides, discovery protocol, stub policy. Every batch yielded analytical discoveries when approached with curiosity rather than as rote data entry. (6) **HANDOFF.md** rewritten emphasizing discovery-driven approach for remaining batches 5-9 (~50 specimens). Validator: 0 errors, 67 warnings. |
| 2026-02-09 | **Session 13: Batch 5 — Defense/Transport (5 placed, 4 gov removed)**. anduril, blue-origin, lockheed-martin, delta-air-lines, fedex placed. Government specimens (nasa, us-cyber-command, new-york-state, us-air-force, pentagon-cdao) removed from synthesis files — political entities with mandate-driven AI adoption don't belong in org economics analysis. Key discoveries: Anduril-Lockheed modularity validation (clean-sheet M9 vs integral M4), Blue Origin M6a CEO provenance outlier (Dave Limp from Amazon Alexa), Delta-FedEx CEO conviction gating (same M4/Contextual, different velocity). |
| 2026-02-09 | **Session 14: Batch 6 — Media/Consumer (9 specimens placed) + Two-Dimensions Hypothesis**. disney, netflix, lionsgate, washington-post, kroger, lowes, nike, pepsico, ulta-beauty. (1) **Batch 6 placement**: All 9 synced to contingencies.json (37 new placements). Nike technicalDebt filled as Medium. Tensions already present from overnight run. (2) **Protocol violation caught**: Skipped interactive discussion step — went straight from reading specimens to writing observations. User corrected: "this should not be entirely automatic." WORKFLOW.md step 5 rewritten as NON-NEGOTIABLE, HANDOFF.md item #21 strengthened. (3) **Collaborative theory discussion (4 rounds)**: User: "I'm wondering about a new tradeoff on the modularity-coordination side." Explored coupling, rejected "augment vs IS the work" as atheoretical, arrived at **two-dimensions-of-tacit-information** hypothesis: (a) tacit info at interfaces → predicts org structure (Conway/Colfer & Baldwin), (b) tacit info within modules → predicts AI penetration depth (new). Disney vs Netflix, Moderna vs Netflix as key discriminating pairs. New hypothesis added to insights.json. (4) Other discoveries: M4/Contextual as consumer-sector default, data-foundation-first extends to retail, Nike CTO elimination as "AI as infrastructure" signal. 55 specimens now fully placed. ~36 remaining (Batches 7-9). |
| 2026-02-10 | **Session 15: Research Pending Triage + Research Agenda**. (1) **Pending folder audit**: Audited all ~80 files in `research/pending/`. Key finding: overnight curation agents already processed nearly everything. 10 Group A research files (deep-scans, earnings, podcasts, sweeps) were all curated into rich specimens. 70 Group B curation artifacts moved to `research/pending/archived-curation-artifacts/`. (2) **Tesla enrichment**: Added Dwarkesh-Musk interview material — Optimus Academy (10-30K robots in self-play), platform-sharing across car/robot (same AI chips), reality generator reuse, Grok as orchestration layer. Completeness: Low→Medium. (3) **3 new field signals**: SaaSmageddon ($285B crash, seat-based pricing collapse), management-as-superpower (Mollick: management skills > technical AI skills), AI agent-to-human ratio as organizational metric (McKinsey 25K agents/40K humans). Total: 30 field signals. (4) **Research queue**: xAI and SpaceX-xAI added as pending (thin on internal structure, need more research). McKinsey deprioritized (meta-case, not core specimen). (5) **Research agenda established**: C (financial services natural experiment: GS vs MS vs JPM), B (healthcare sector deep dive), D (fresh podcast/conference sweep), A (enrich thin Batch 7-9 specimens), then purpose claims refresh. (6) **Financial services research agent launched** (Opus, background) — scanning for GS/MS/JPM structural comparisons. (7) **Botanist flags documented** in HANDOFF.md — 6 observations from overnight files worth collaborative discussion (Goldman build-and-handoff model, CIO-not-CAIO choice, Solomon's rhetorical ambidexterity, Argenti's AI natives thesis, Morgan Stanley 98% adoption, SaaSmageddon macro context). (8) **HANDOFF.md rewritten** for Session 15+ with research agenda and botanist observation flags. |
| 2026-02-10 | **Session 15b (continuation): Finserv Enrichment + Healthcare Research**. (1) **JPMorgan enriched** with finserv natural experiment findings: dual-track AI leadership (Heitsenrether CDAO + Veloso AI Research), Operating Committee membership, 3 Dimon quotes ("We took AI and data out of technology"), 3 new sources. Completeness: Medium→High. (2) **Goldman Sachs enriched**: AI Champions from business divisions, multi-model vendor strategy, Anthropic embedded engineers, infrastructure-first tradeoff acknowledgment, deliberate opacity (1,200+ AI articles, little internal detail). 3 new sources, 3 new Argenti quotes. New layer added. (3) **Morgan Stanley enriched**: McMillan reports to co-presidents (not CTO/CIO), AI Steering Group co-chaired with Research Head (Huberty), division-specific AI products (AI@MS, Debrief, AskResearchGPT), deep single-vendor OpenAI partnership, ML Research team publishes at NeurIPS/IJCAI/ICLR. 3 new sources, 1 new quote. New layer added. (4) **Healthcare research agent completed**: 308-line output covering 6 existing + 6 new specimen candidates. Key findings: 3 healthcare CAIO variants (clinician-CAIO, technologist-CAIO, dual-hat CMIO/CAIO), payer vs. provider governance gap (UnitedHealth 90% denial overturn rate), Joint Commission/CHAI sector-level AI governance standards (first externally-standardized sector), academic vs. community structural divide. HIGH priority new specimens: Cedars-Sinai (dual-reporting CAIO), Mass General Brigham (1,800+ digital staff, AI spinout company), Kaiser Permanente (integrated payer-provider, dual-hat CMIO/CAIO). Output: `research/pending/healthcare-sector-deep-dive.json`. |
| 2026-02-12 | **Session 16b: Protocol + Docs Hardcoded Count Audit**. (1) **Curation protocol strengthened**: Added "Classification Reasoning" table and "Cross-Cutting Patterns" section to session log template in `curation/CURATION-PROTOCOL.md`. Step B (Classify) now explicitly requires recording decision tree path, guardrail checks, and cross-cutting observations. (2) **Hardcoded count audit across 12 .md files**: Found ~80 stale-risk instances across CLAUDE.md, WORKFLOW.md, Ambidexterity_Field_Guide_Spec.md, SW_ARCHITECTURE.md, NARRATIVE_SPEC.md, VISUAL_DESIGN_SPEC.md. Worst offender: Spec.md Section 12 ("Current State as of Feb 3") with ~35 stale counts — replaced with pointer to APP_STATE.md. All protocol/spec files now use generic descriptors ("see APP_STATE.md for current counts") instead of hardcoded numbers for growing collections (specimens, insights, claims, candidates). Fixed categories: STALE-RISK (made generic), FIXED (left: taxonomy 9×3, 5 tensions, 5 contingencies, 7 guardrails), SESSION-LOG (left: historical records). APP_STATE.md mechanism candidates updated 9→14. |
| 2026-02-12 | **Session 16: Enrichment Curation (6 specimens)**. Processed 6 enrichment agent outputs from `research/pending/enrich-*.json`. Reclassifications: Thomson Reuters M6a→M4+M5 (acqui-hire CTO, TR Labs hub, 20K Open Arena users), HP Inc M6→M4+M5 (three AI pillars: HP IQ, HP Labs, divisional embedding; CEO departure uncertainty), Panasonic M2→M4+M5 (Group CAIO, Blue Yonder subsidiary, Business CEO dual-hats), Recruit Holdings M6→M3 (dual-hat CEO, Glassdoor absorption, product-embedded AI), CrowdStrike null→M3 (CTO-led, Charlotte AI multi-agent, CTO/CTIO dual lanes). Kyndryl confirmed M2 Low→Medium. **Key pattern**: 4/4 M6 specimens from workforce-reduction-only sources were wrong — all reclassified after discovering named AI units. Net shifts: M2 21→20, M3 9→11, M4 59→62, M6 24→21. Registry, synthesis-queue, and session log updated. Validator: 0 errors, 67 warnings (pre-existing). |
| 2026-02-12 | **Session 16c: Curation — 4 New Specimens from Pending Research**. Created 4 new specimens from `research/pending/` outputs: Cedars-Sinai (M4+M1, Structural, dual-reporting CAIO to CIO+CMO, AI Council, CAIRE research center, 3 informatics officers), Mass General Brigham (M4+M5, Structural, 1,800+ digital staff under CDIO, AIwithCare spinout), Kaiser Permanente (M4, Contextual, Low confidence, dual-hat CMIO/CAIO, integrated payer-provider natural experiment), McKinsey (M4+M2, Contextual, 60K entities = 40K humans + 25K AI agents, QuantumBlack 40% revenue). Tesla enrichment skipped (already done in Session 15c). **Patterns**: Healthcare M4 convergence (now 8+ healthcare M4 specimens), dual-authority governance as healthcare-specific M4 variant, AI agents as organizational members (McKinsey first). **Total specimens: 147** (M4: 66, Structural: 97, Contextual: 45). 10 specimens pending synthesis. |
| 2026-02-12 | **Session 17: Spider Diagrams, Citation System, Enrichment Wiring**. (1) **Enrichment display completed**: Wired EnrichmentSummary into PurposeClaimsTab and PurposeClaimsBrowser (compact spider in sidebar, green enrichment dots). Fixed 3 insights with string evidence (normalized to arrays). (2) **Spider/radar charts**: Created reusable SpiderChart.tsx (pure React SVG, 6 axes, grid rings, comparison overlay, hover tooltips). Created spider-data.ts (normalizeDistribution with TARGET_MAX=0.85 rescaling, averageDistributions, rawProportions). Replaced DistributionBar in EnrichmentSummary with spider charts (220px full, 140px compact). (3) **Spider grid for Purpose Claims page**: Created ClaimsSpiderGrid.tsx replacing ClaimsHeatmap — groups by structural model or industry, shows large average spider + small individual spiders per group, hover shows comparison overlay. View mode label renamed "Heatmap" → "Profiles". (4) **Citation/auditability system**: Created citations.ts parser for `[source-id]` inline markers. Created CitedText.tsx component (superscript numbered links with hover metadata). Wired into OverviewTab (description + observable markers). Updated CURATION-PROTOCOL.md with citation format + metrics capture guidance. Backfilled apple.json with 8 source citations across all 5 markers. (5) **Spider rendering fix**: Rescaled normalizeDistribution so max axis reaches 0.85 of radius (was ~0.17 for balanced distributions — polygons were unreadably small). Reduced axis line opacity/weight. Added rawProportions() for accurate tooltip percentages. Updated averageDistributions to work from raw counts. Build verified clean. |
| 2026-02-10 | **Session 15c (continuation): Healthcare Enrichment + Podcast/Conference Sweep (Research Agenda D)**. (1) **All 5 healthcare specimens enriched** via `scripts/enrich-healthcare-deep-dive.py`: Sutter Health (clinician-CAIO, 1.5M hours, Aidoc, Beecy quote), UnitedHealth (Optum tripartite, governance failure layer, 4 open questions), Mount Sinai (named leaders Stump/Freeman/Gavin, Dragon Copilot), Mayo Clinic (Department authority, Platform sub-units, tournament framework), CVS Health (Mandadi quote, cross-business platform). (2) **Podcast/conference sweep completed** (Research Agenda D): 14 searches, 7 URL fetches. HIGH findings: McKinsey 60K "employees" (40K humans + 25K AI agents, QuantumBlack = 40% revenue), Dwarkesh-Musk (xAI rejects "lab" label, sequential bottleneck elimination), Mollick "Management as AI Superpower" (resource scarcity inversion), SaaStr 10 SDRs → 20 AI agents + 1.2 humans. Conference: Davos (org design = bottleneck, "human in the lead"), NRF (CIO-CEO tension), CES (AI-as-operating-model). (3) **7 new field signals** added (total: 37): ai-agents-as-org-members, management-scarcity-inversion, cio-ceo-governance-tension, davos-org-design-bottleneck, ai-governance-maturity-gap, professional-services-dual-restructuring, saas-to-agent-orchestration. 3 existing signals enriched. (4) **3 new botanist flags** (#12-14): McKinsey as specimen revisit, Mollick scarcity inversion, "human in the lead not in the loop". New specimen candidates: McKinsey (HIGH), Siemens (MEDIUM), SaaStr (MEDIUM). |
| 2026-02-12 | **Session 18: Batch 7 Placement + Purpose Claims Merge**. (1) **Batch 7 complete** (7 specimens: kyndryl, panasonic, t-mobile, uber, chegg, thomson-reuters, recruit-holdings). 21 tension placements + 3 corrections + 2 manual additions, 17 contingency placements + duplicate cleanup. Total placed: 104. (2) **Product-production convergence hypothesis** added to insights.json — for SaaS/services firms where AI is both product and production method, internal/external boundaries dissolve (Salesforce Agentforce = sharpest case, Conway's Law feedback loop). Connects to Nadella/Coase. (3) **M4 taxonomy review flagged** — 5/6 Batch 7 specimens classified M4, decision tree too permissive. Uber AI Labs looks like M1+M3 not true hub-and-spoke. All 65+ M4 specimens need audit. (4) **62 purpose claims merged** from 4 Opus agents (Morgan Stanley 16, Netflix 14, Disney 14, Intel 18). Registry now 917 claims across ~39 specimens. Key findings: sector rhetorical signatures (finserv = commercial-success only; media = diverse/political; semiconductor turnaround = identity-heavy), "absent technical leader" pattern confirmed in media/entertainment, CEO succession changes rhetorical register not just strategy. (5) **Field journal**: `synthesis/sessions/2026-02-12-batch7-placement.md` with all 8 structural observations + purpose claims analysis. |
| 2026-02-12 | **Session 19: Batch 8 Placement (Big Tech) + Purpose Claims Haul (53 claims)**. (1) **Batch 8 partial placement** (google-deepmind, apple, ami-labs tensions/contingencies updated). 3 structural insights added: expelled-exploration (hypothesis), research-output-as-production-tool (hypothesis), tight-coupling-modularity-constraint (hypothesis). meta-exploration-failure promoted to confirmed. (2) **53 purpose claims merged** from 4 Opus agents (Ford 12, BMW 12, Honeywell 15, Toyota 14). Registry now 970 claims across ~43 specimens. (3) **3 purpose claims insights added**: survival-rhetoric-signals-structural-absence (hypothesis), rhetorical-division-mirrors-structure (emerging), sector-rhetorical-signatures (emerging). Total insights: 49. (4) **Key findings**: Industrial CEOs use purpose claims fundamentally differently from tech CEOs — zero utopian claims across all 53 industrial claims; survival rhetoric inversely correlated with structural exploration investment (Ford vs BMW); rhetorical division of labor mirrors M4 structural division (Toyota Pratt/Kursar, Honeywell Kapur/Jordan). BMW's pure identity authorization (zero survival despite industry disruption) is most distinctive rhetorical profile documented. (5) **Synthesis protocol updated** with Analytical Depth Requirement. (6) **Field journal**: `synthesis/sessions/2026-02-12-batch8-placement.md`. |
| 2026-02-12 | **Session 22: Purpose-Structure Complementarity Reframing**. Major analytical session. Reframed entire purpose claims track from "diagnostic tool" to "complementary organizational responses" — purpose rhetoric and organizational structure are co-produced, not independent channels. Milgrom & Roberts (1990, 1995) complementarities argument: coherence between structural design and purpose rhetoric predicts transformation effectiveness. **4 insights amended**: rhetorical-division-mirrors-structure (co-production framing), survival-rhetoric (substitution framing, promoted hypothesis→emerging), sector-rhetorical-signatures (institutional boundary conditions), inverse-grove (added rhetorical signature). **3 insights added**: purpose-structure-complementarity (overarching insight), ceo-silence-spectrum (Uber sole-voice to Nike silence as complementary design choices), coasean-purpose-claims (flagging theory-of-the-firm statements — Khosrowshahi "company is a rule," Nadella's explicit Coase reference). Total insights: 55 (was 52). Field journal: `synthesis/sessions/2026-02-12-purpose-structure-complementarity.md`. Script: `scripts/purpose-insights-reframe.py`. Build verified. |
| 2026-02-12 | **Session 21: M4 Taxonomy Audit + Citation Backfill + Purpose Claims Merge**. (1) **M4 taxonomy audit**: Applied Guardrail 8 across all 66 M4 specimens. 19 reclassified: 13 definite (lacking evidence of coordinating hub) + 6 borderline (thin evidence, downgraded). Net shifts: M4 66→48, M2 20→25, M3 11→16, M6 21→28, M1 6→7. Updated curation protocol with Guardrail 8 (M4 Overclassification Prevention) and strengthened decision tree. (2) **Purpose claims merge**: 56 new claims from 4 Opus agents (Bloomberg 14, Lockheed Martin 14, Mercedes-Benz 16, PepsiCo 12) merged via `scripts/merge-batch10-claims.py`. **Registry now 1,082 claims** across ~51 specimens. (3) **Citation backfill**: All 30 High-completeness specimens now have inline `[source-id]` citations in observable markers (was only Apple). Batch 1 (10 specimens via `scripts/citation-backfill-batch1.py`), Batch 2 (17 specimens via `scripts/citation-backfill-batch2.py`), plus meta-ai and google-x patched separately. Every citation validated against specimen source arrays. Build verified clean. |
| 2026-02-12 | **Session 22b: Batch 11 Purpose Claims (M4 Hub-Spoke) + Cross-Model Insights + Batch 12 Launched**. (1) **Batch 11 merged**: Thomson Reuters 16, Deere & Co 14, UnitedHealth Group 16, Delta Air Lines 14 = 60 claims via `scripts/merge-batch11-claims.py`. **Registry: 1,142 claims** across ~55 specimens. Key batch finding: "Industry > Structure for Rhetoric" — all 4 are M4 but rhetorical registers vary dramatically by industry. (2) **5 insights updated/added** via `scripts/update-insights-batch11.py`: ceo-silence-spectrum (+4 evidence, 3 new patterns: strategic CEO silence, coordinated duet, rhetorical cascade), rhetorical-division-mirrors-structure (+2), sector-rhetorical-signatures (+4, disconfirms prediction), purpose-structure-complementarity (+3), commercial-moral-register-convergence (NEW — orgs construct purpose at commercial-moral intersection). (3) **2 cross-model insights added** via `scripts/update-insights-batch11-crossmodel.py`: structural-separation-licenses-non-commercial-rhetoric (explore models 14.2% vs execute models 28.5% commercial-success), ai-first-teleological-concentration (M9 23.1% teleological, 2-7x other models). **Total insights: 58**. (4) **Batch 12 launched**: 4 Opus agents (kroger M4, exxonmobil M6, crowdstrike M3, fedex M2) — model diversity theme. Output expected in `research/purpose-claims/pending/`. Needs merge next session. |
| 2026-02-12 | **Session 23: Batch 12 Purpose Claims Merged (Model Diversity, +54 claims)**. Merged 4 Opus agent outputs: Kroger 12, ExxonMobil 12, CrowdStrike 16, FedEx 14. **Registry: 1,196 claims** across ~59 specimens. Theme: model diversity (M2×2, M3, M6). Key observations: (1) CrowdStrike breaks "industrial = no utopian" pattern — adversarial habitat licenses martial/epochal language, (2) Rhetorical locus follows structural center of AI capability (Kroger's 84.51° SVP > CEO), (3) ExxonMobil dual-identity: internal adopter + external AI enabler, (4) Anti-hype as deliberate rhetorical strategy (Kroger berry freshness, FedEx dollar-figure anchoring), (5) CrowdStrike layoff→reassurance arc is clearest purpose-claims-as-organizational-management case. Cross-model Pattern A (structural separation licenses non-commercial rhetoric) confirmed: all 4 execute-oriented specimens show high commercial-success rates. Script: `scripts/merge-batch12-claims.py`. Session file: `research/purpose-claims/sessions/2026-02-12-batch-12-model-diversity.md`. |
| 2026-02-12 | **Session 24: Research Agent Recovery (7 agents, crashed session recovered)**. Recovered outputs from 7 Opus research agents that completed before the prior session crashed. (1) **Podcast/substack sweep**: Rivian (new, MEDIUM), Meta compute pivot, Lila Sciences. BG2 on hiatus. (2) **Press sweep**: Rich Tier 1 findings — xAI (new, HIGH), Salesforce evolution, Amazon 30K cuts, Klarna reversal deepens, Kyndryl, ASML counter-example. (3) **CAIO/reorg discovery**: 11+ orgs — Anthropic Labs reshuffle, SK Telecom CIC→CTO, Intuit Foresight (HIGH), Lionsgate first entertainment CAIO, FDA/HHS CAIOs. (4) **xAI deep scan**: 4 divisions, SpaceX acquisition, 6/12 co-founders departed, MACROHARDRR data center. (5) **Intuit deep scan**: **Richest new discovery** — M4 hub-spoke with Intuit Foresight unit, GenOS platform, 3-pillar AI org, dual AI tracks. (6) **Klarna AI backfire**: Complete 2022-2026 reversal timeline, 22% satisfaction drop, CEO admission. (7) **Salesforce evolution**: 5 exec departures, Agentforce+Slack consolidation, 3 AI leaders in <3 years. Merged 7 entries into `research/queue.json` (total: 56). Updated `specimens/source-registry.json` scan dates through Feb 12. 2 agents (earnings-q4-second-pass, jpm-healthcare-conference) hung on WebFetch — lost work, need retry. Session file: `research/sessions/2026-02-12-session-24-research-agents.md`. |
| 2026-02-12 | **Session 24b: Botanist Discussion — 5 Analytical Threads for Curation**. Collaborative analysis of Session 24 research agent findings. (1) **Measurement-driven moral hazard**: Holmstrom (1979) multi-task framing — AI transition metrics systematically overstate success (cost/speed) while missing quality/trust/knowledge degradation. Klarna sharpest case (CEO admission). 6-question curation audit protocol created. May be the mechanism behind inverse-Grove. (2) **Exploration→execution leadership transitions**: xAI (6/12 co-founders out), Salesforce (3 AI leaders, narrowing scope). Garicano knowledge-hierarchy framing. (3) **Intuit dual AI tracks**: Foresight (outward/long-term) + CoE (inward/short-term) maps to two-dimensions-of-tacit-information hypothesis. GenOS as platform-mediated ambidexterity. (4) **Customer Zero at institutional scale**: Salesforce product-production convergence eating itself (Agentforce team laid off). (5) **Augmentation→replacement rhetorical arc**: Benioff and Siemiatkowski both shifted register. All 5 threads documented with curation pickup table in session file. Botanist flags #18-21 added to HANDOFF.md. HANDOFF rewritten to point next session at curation with these analytical lenses. |
| 2026-02-13 | **Session 25: Batch Curation (15 specimens)**. (1) **2 new specimens**: Intuit (M4+M2, Structural, High — dual AI tracks, GenOS platform, three-level goal framework), xAI (M5b+M1, Temporal, High — 4 product divisions, 50% co-founder departure, Macrohard). (2) **2 major updates**: Salesforce (5 exec departures, Inzerillo consolidation, Customer Zero, augmentation→replacement arc, completeness→High), Klarna (full reversal timeline: 22% satisfaction drop, 900+ BBB complaints, emergency redeployment, Uber-style hybrid, IPO+lawsuit, completeness→High). (3) **11 incremental updates**: Meta (compute pivot), Amazon (30K cuts), Pinterest (dissent suppression), Workday (founder return), Dow (Transform to Outperform), HP (4K-6K cuts), SK Telecom (CIC→CTO), Anthropic (Labs incubator), Lionsgate (first entertainment CAIO), Kyndryl (SAP CoE), Infosys (Cursor AI CoE). **Registry: 149 specimens**. 8 field journal observations documented for botanist discussion. |
| 2026-02-13 | **Session 25b: Botanist Discussion + 3 New Insights**. Discussed 8 field observations from batch curation. Key analytical moves: (1) measurement-driven-moral-hazard (emerging) — Holmstrom multi-task applied to AI transitions, metrics overstate success; (2) measurement-inverse-grove-connection (hypothesis) — measurement failure is the causal mechanism behind inverse-Grove pattern; (3) tacit-knowledge-destruction-irreversibility (emerging) — AI workforce cuts destroy knowledge that cannot be recovered. Updated inverse-grove with Klarna full reversal + measurement connection. Updated two-dimensions-of-tacit-information with Klarna evidence. **Total insights: 64**. |
| 2026-02-13 | **Session 26: Batches 13-14 Purpose Claims + Botanical Analysis**. (1) **Batch 13 merged**: visa 14, honda 14, panasonic 10, lionsgate 11 = 49 claims. (2) **Batch 14 merged**: cognizant 16, hp-inc 14, lowes 16, cvs-health 14 = 60 claims. Total: 109 claims via `scripts/merge-batch13-14-claims.py`. **Registry: 1,305 claims** across ~67 specimens. (3) **Botanical analysis**: 5 existing insights updated with new evidence (rhetorical-division +5, ceo-silence-spectrum +3, sector-rhetorical-signatures +5, survival-rhetoric +2, anti-caio-thesis 1 updated). 3 new insights added: heritage-as-authorization (Japanese founder mythology as AI authorization), audience-dependent-claim-ordering (systematic inversion by stakeholder), ceo-departure-natural-experiment (HP Inc Lores departure). **Total insights: 64** (12 purpose-claims). Script: `scripts/update-insights-batch13-14.py`. Field journals: `research/purpose-claims/sessions/2026-02-13-batch-13-14.md` (merge), `2026-02-13-batch-13-14-insights.md` (analysis). |
| 2026-02-12 | **Session 20: Batch 8 Closed + Batch 9 Complete + 3 Major Hypotheses + 56 Purpose Claims**. (1) **Batch 8 closed**: meta-reality-labs deprecated and merged into meta-ai (all cross-references updated: registry, synthesis-queue, scan-tracker, insights.json). (2) **Batch 9 complete** (6 specimens: salesforce, sap, crowdstrike, hp-inc, pinterest, workday). Rich interactive placement session yielding 3 major hypotheses. (3) **3 new insights**: `inverse-grove` (hypothesis — leaders who internalized Grove's lesson overcorrect, pushing AI faster than orgs/markets absorb; evidence: Salesforce, Klarna, Meta, BMW), `ai-infrastructure-vs-actor-counter-positioning` (emerging — firms in same industry counter-position on AI visibility; SAP/Salesforce, BMW/Tesla, Roche/Moderna, Goldman/JPMorgan), `dual-tempo-ai-structures` (emerging — splitting AI mandates at different time horizons within one org unit; CrowdStrike CTO/CTIO, Uber AI Labs). Total insights: 52. (4) **C6 contingency added**: `environmentalAiPull` — how strongly external environment demands AI adoption; predicts whether original Grove (too slow, high pull) or inverse Grove (too fast, low pull) is primary risk. Now 6 contingencies. (5) **56 purpose claims merged** from 4 agents (Uber 16, Nike 12, Anduril 12, Intel deep-scan 16). **Registry: 1,026 claims** across ~47 specimens. Cross-cutting observations: CEO Silence Spectrum, Dual Displacement Problem (Uber), Moral Inversion (Anduril), Sport-Identity Shield (Nike), Coasean CEO (Uber). (6) **All synthesis batches (1-9) now complete**: ~110+ specimens fully placed across tensions (T1-T5) and contingencies (C1-C6). (7) **Field journals**: `synthesis/sessions/2026-02-12-batch9-placement.md`, `research/purpose-claims/sessions/2026-02-12-batch-9-cross-industry.md`. |
| 2026-02-13 | **Session 25c: Split session log from APP_STATE.md into SESSION_LOG.md** to reduce context window consumption. APP_STATE.md now references this file. |
| 2026-02-13 | **Session 27: Session 24 Claims Extraction + Healthcare Merge + Synthesis Update**. (1) **Session 24 purpose claims extracted** (+31): Built `scripts/merge-session24-claims.py` — 9 xAI (new specimen), 9 Intuit (new specimen), 4 Klarna (reversal arc), 5 Salesforce (Benioff "I need less heads"), 1 Dow Chemical (first claim), 2 Anthropic (Krieger stepping DOWN), 1 Pinterest (coercive alignment). Registry: 1,305→1,336. (2) **Healthcare purpose claims merged** (+48): Cedars-Sinai 16, Mayo Clinic 18, Mount Sinai 14. Registry: 1,336→1,384. (3) **Botanist discussion**: Session 24 key findings — Klarna reversal is measurement-driven moral hazard smoking gun, Krieger's downward role move structurally unique, xAI departure rhetoric is counter-purpose claims. Healthcare key finding — strong institutional mission produces identity-confirming, authentically anodyne purpose claims (low rhetorical effort where mission pre-exists). Open question: authentic internalization vs. formulaic messaging. (4) **New insight** (#65): `mission-identity-anodyne-rhetoric` (hypothesis) — where pre-existing institutional mission is strong, purpose claims are identity-confirming and rhetorically flat; parallels heritage-as-authorization in Japanese specimens. (5) **Synthesis updated**: Mechanisms (M1 Anthropic evidence, M5 +intuit +mayo-clinic, M6 +xai +salesforce, M8 +cedars-sinai, AI-Driven Headcount Reduction +klarna counterevidence), Tensions (T2 +xai +mount-sinai +klarna, T5 +intuit), Contingencies (talentMarketPosition +mayo-clinic +cedars-sinai +mount-sinai). **Total: 1,384 claims, 65 insights, 149 tracker specimens.** |
